{dearmad_pisa_desc}Named Count | Podesta of Pisa and ruler of Tuscany.\n\nDescription:\nPisan Republic became the first Italian naval power, having established its control over Corsica and Sardinia in XI-XII and established trading colonies in almost all major ports of the Mediterranean Sea. Pisa was based on intermediary trade, primarily with the Levant, Byzantium and the Spanish states. Already during the period of Byzantine and Lombard domination, the rise of maritime trade in the cities of the Italian coast began. The first power of independence and the need to organize the defense of Italy's coasts from an external threat (first by Byzantium, then by the Arabs) appeared in these cities. XI Pisa turned into an important shopping center that competes with the coastal cities of southern Italy (Amalfi, Naples, Bari) However, the main obstacle to the further development of maritime trade of the city was the incessant raids of Arabs on the Italian and South French shores. Another feature of Pisa was the close involvement of the local aristocracy in the sea kuyu trade, which explains the aristocratic character and the absence of antagonism between the nobility and the merchant in the XII elitoy.Hotya Pisa political system has been somewhat democratized, at the head of the city got elected podesta, and in the election of public officials admitted the wider trade and craft circles.

Already during the period of Byzantine and Lombard domination, the rise of sea trade in the cities of the Italian coast began. and the need to organize the defense of Italy's coasts from an external threat (first from Byzantium, then from the Arabs), the first elements of independence appeared in these cities. XI Pisa turned into an important shopping center that competes with the coastal cities of Southern Italy (Amalfi, Naples, Bari). However, the main obstacle to the further development of the city’s maritime trade was the incessant raids of Arabs on the Italian and South French shores.

I say that predetermined the aristocratic nature and the absence of antagonism between the nobility and the merchant elite. Although in the XIIth century the political system of Pisa was somewhat democratized, an elected Podesta headed the city, and wider strata of trade and craft circles were allowed in the elections of state bodies.

Already in the IX century, it becomes the center of Seversky land, one of the largest cities in Ancient Rus`.

On the Volga-Don Road, Chernihiv maintained contact with the Arab East. Crafts, agriculture and trade were the basis of the economic activity of Chernihiv. In the XI-XIII centuries, the capital city of the Chernigov-Seversky principality, which occupied vast areas of the left bank of the Dnieper, had one of the strongest princely squads. At the end of the XI century in ancient Rus`, princely feuds erupted again. The city repeatedly passed from hand to hand.

{king_severskiy}Prince of Novgorod-Seversky
{king_novgorod-severskiy_desc}Named Prince Novgorod-Seversky.\n\nDescription:\nThe first annalistic mention of the “new city” in the land of the northerners is contained in the “Teaching to Children” by Vladimir Monomakh. In the middle of the 10th century, the city was already a fully developed social organism - with a princely court, temples, good houses of warriors and artisans, with a trading post, which, as expected, consisted of a roundabout city, prison and hem. The economy of ancient Novgorod-Seversky was based on crafts, trade, agriculture, cattle breeding, karting, hunting, and fishing. Well-developed iron and pottery production. The first fortified settlement on the site of the city appeared at the end of the X century, during the reign of Vladimir Svyatoslavovich, although some historians prefer to connect the foundation of Novgorod-Seversky with the conquest of Yaroslav the Wise in 1044. For many years the city remained a defensive outpost for Kiev from the Polovtsy, the second most important city of the Chernigov Principality. After the Lyubech Congress of Princes in 1097, Novgorod-Seversky became the center of an extensive specific princedom, the clan nest of the Olgovichi - active participants in feudal strife.

Moreover, the more than 300-kilometer massif of steppes and forest-steppes between the Black Sea and the Ros River remained virtually uninhabited by the Eastern Slavs due to the constant invasions of nomadic tribes from Asia, and therefore even during the years of relative migration lull. Oleshya was of unusually important strategic importance, as it was located at the intersection of land and sea routes at the Dnieper into the Black Sea, connecting Rus` through Byzantium with the Mediterranean Sea and Western Europe and around Crimea through the Sea of ​​Azov, Don and the Volga with the Caspian Sea and the Arab world. It was in Olesha that numerous ambassadors from Byzantium, the Caucasus, and Near Asia were met. In Oleshia, the Kiev princes also accepted Byzantine candidates for the Kiev metropolitan chair.
