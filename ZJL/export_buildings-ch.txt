{knights_of_santiago_major_ch_southern_european_desc}The Great Military Order of the Sword of St. James of Compostela is a Catholic military order founded in Spain around 1160 to protect pilgrims on their way to holy places - not to the Holy Land, but on the way to Santiago de Compostela, the main center of pilgrimage in Western Europe.\n\n
The Order of Santiago, along with other Spanish and Portuguese orders, took part in the wars with Muslims and the Crusades. The maritime campaigns of the order, which required rowers to go to the galleys, gave rise to a peculiar custom that existed until the 18th century: candidates for knights had to serve as rowers for six months; the majority, however, preferred to pay off this duty. Candidates for membership of the order had to confirm the nobility of the origin of all their grandfathers and grandmothers; in fact, the nobility of the father was a sufficient condition, since a significant part of the members of the order initially had the right to legal marriage, confirmed by the Pope.

{knights_of_santiago_minor_ch_southern_european_desc_short}In the Chapter of the Order you can hire knights of this order.

{merchant_vault_greek_desc}Solid (from Latin solidus-solid) is a Roman gold coin issued in 309 by Emperor Constantine (weighed 1/72 of the Roman pound (4.55 grams).) It replaced aureus and in 324 was introduced in the Roman Empire. For a long time, it remained the main coin and monetary unit of the Roman Empire, then the Roma Empire.The Greek name of the Roma solida is "nomism," in Europe it was more often called "besant" or "bisantine." In Europe, inaccessibility of gold sources and the decline in trade led to almost complete cessation of the minting of its own golden mo Ety in the IX-XII centuries. The main coinage metals become silver. Solid was monetary unit of account. It was equivalent to 12 dinarius

{printing_house_middle_eastern_desc}The first paper workshop was built in Samarkand by the Arabs (after the capture of the city in 751) with the help of captured Chinese in the VIII cc.

For five centuries they kept a monopoly on the production of paper, carefully guarding the secret of its production. But all the secret sooner or later becomes obvious. In Europe, the paper came through Arab Spain and Sicily to Italy in the XIII century.\nThere is a legend that one knight, a participant in the crusade, was captured and was sent to Damascus, where he worked in a paper workshop. Upon his return to his homeland, he founded the first paper mill. Italians have another legend, as a young monk in anger chewed his linen shirt and spit on the tile stove. In the morning he noticed that the mass, glued to the smooth surface of the tile, is very even and resembles parchment. The monk tried the ink on this surface and saw that you can write on it.

{wonder_tower_of_london}伦敦塔
{wonder_tower_of_london_desc}The founding of the Tower is attributed to William I. After the Norman conquest of England, William I began to erect defensive castles to frighten the conquered Anglo-Saxons. One of the biggest in 1078 was the Tower. The wooden fort was replaced by a huge stone building - the Great Tower, which is a quadrangular structure, measuring 32 x 36 meters, about 30 meters high. When later the new King of England ordered the building to whitewash, it was called the White Tower, or the White Tower. Later, under King Richard the Lionheart, several towers of different heights and two rows of powerful fortifications were erected. Around the fortress was dug a deep ditch, making it one of the most impregnable fortresses in Europe.\n\n
   The reputation of the sinister place of torture was acquired by the Tower during the Reformation. Henry VIII, possessed by the desire to have an heir son, severed all relations with the Roman Catholic Church and began to persecute all those who refused to recognize him as head of the Church of England. After Henry's second wife, Anna Boleyn, could not give birth to his son, the king accused her of treason and adultery. As a result, Anna, her brother and four other persons were beheaded in the Tower. The same fate befell Catherine Howard, the fifth wife of Henry. Many royal family members who posed a threat to the English throne were escorted to the Tower and then executed.\n\n
   The young son of Henry, the Protestant Edward VI, who ascended the throne, continued the series of severe executions begun by his father. When, six years later, Edward died, the English crown went to Henry's daughter Mary, a zealous Catholic. Without losing time, the new queen ordered beheaded 16-year-old lady Jane Gray and her young wife Guilford Dudley, who turned out to be pawns in a fierce power struggle. Now it is time for the Protestants to lay down their heads. Elizabeth, the half-sister of Mary, spent several disturbing weeks in the Tower. However, becoming a queen, she dealt with those who refused to change the Catholic faith and dared to oppose her rule.\n\n
   Although thousands of prisoners were thrown into the Tower, only five women and two men were beheaded in the fortress, which saved them from the shame of the public execution. Three of these women were queens - it's Anna Boleyn, Catherine Howard and Jane Gray, who stayed on the throne for only nine days. Most of the other executions-basically mismanagement-took place at a nearby Tower Hill, where huge crowds of fans of such shows flocked. The cut off head was put on a stake and put on public display on the London Bridge as a warning to the rest. The decapitated body was taken to the Tower and was buried in the cellars of the chapel. In these cellars, a total of more than 1,500 bodies were buried.

{wonder_colosseus}大竞技场
{wonder_colosseus_desc}The history of the Colosseum dates back to the year 68, when the betrayal of the Praetorian Guard and the condemnation of the Senate forced the Emperor Nero, after fourteen years of despotic government rule, to commit suicide in a country villa near Rome. The death of Nero led to an eighteen-month civil war that ended in 69. The victory was won by Titus Flavius ​​Vespasian.\n\nAfter becoming emperor, Vespasian took part in the suppression of the Jewish revolt, which began in 66 AD. After this, Vespasian, together with Titus in the rich eastern provinces, collected taxes to tidy up public finances, upset by Nero and the civil war. They returned to Rome in 71 to celebrate the victory over the Jews.\n\nWith the emperor, Vespasian decided to reconstruct the center of Rome and consolidate his own cult, eradicating the memory of his predecessor Nero. The uneasy problem remained unresolved: what to do with the palace of Nero, the Golden House, as it was called, which, together with the adjoining park, occupied 120 hectares in the center of Rome. Vespasian decided to place the imperial institutions in it, and the lake near the house to fall asleep and build an amphitheater designed for the entertainment of the people. This was a well-thought-out decision: the building of the amphitheater of land that Nero used was passed on to the people.\n\nThe construction of the largest amphitheater in the entire ancient world, with a capacity of more than 50 thousand people, was conducted for eight years as a collective construction of the Flavian dynasty emperors. It began to be built in 72 AD. e. under the emperor Vespasian, and in 80 AD. e. The amphitheater was consecrated by the emperor Titus. The amphitheater is located on the spot where there was a pond, which belonged to the Golden House of Nero.\n\n The celebrations on the occasion of the opening of the Colosseum lasted one hundred days. During that time in the arena of the Coliseum, 5,000 predators brought from northern Africa and hundreds of gladiators were killed. During his existence, the Colosseus saw many things: gladiator fights (usually they were specially trained slaves), hunting predatory animals brought from distant lands, sea fights, for which the arena was flooded with water. And, finally, the Colosseum was the site of the martyrdom of the first Christians.\n\nThe four main entrances to the Colosseum made it possible to make a quick passage to the arena, and in 80 arches in just 10 minutes it was possible to appear on numbered visual spots. Often spectators spent here several days in a row, so they brought food with them from home. The total average capacity of the Colosseum was about 50 thousand people, but could enter up to 68 thousand. But there were no toilets.\n\nThe entrance to the Colosseum was free. Before the entrance to the stadium, flour for baking bread was handed out free of charge. In the uppermost rows of the Colosseum there were slaves, operating elevators. In total there were 36 elevators in the Coliseum. And even above the slaves were sailors of the Imperial Navy. What did they do there? They ran a huge linen canvas that covered the Coliseum from above in such a way that the arena remained always open, but in case of rain or intense heat it was hidden under the awning. For this purpose, a complex construction consisting of 240 pillars was built here, supporting giant material.\n\nInfuries of the barbarians led the Flavian Amphitheater to desolation and laid the foundation for its destruction. From the 11th century until 1132, it was a fortress for the noble Roman clans that contested each other's influence and power over their fellow citizens, especially for the names of Frangipani and Annibaldi. The latter, however, were forced to yield the Colosseum to Emperor Henry VII, who presented it to the Roman Senate and the people. Back in 1332, the local aristocracy arranged here bullfights, but from this time the systematic destruction of the Colosseum began.

{wonder_stonehenge}巨石阵
{wonder_stonehenge_desc}The world famous megalithic stone megalithic-cromlech on the Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire in England, located about 130 km south-west of London.\n\nThe construction of Stonehenge took place in several stages, taking a total of over 2000 years. However, archaeologists have found evidence of the presence on this site of much older buildings. The location of the pillars shows that they supported a very large wooden monument, whose age is estimated at about 8000 years.\n\nAround 2600 BC, wooden structures were demolished, and in return appeared majestic stone structures. First, the builders dug out two rows of large holes in the form of a crescent (one horseshoe inside the other), deployed to the northeast. For 385 kilometers from here, From the rocks of Karn Menin in the hills of Preseli (Wales), 80 so-called "blue stones" were delivered. Each stone had about 2 meters in height, about 1.5 meters in width and 0.8 meters in thickness. They hung up 4-5 tons.\n\nIn the heart of Stonehenge put six-ton ​​monolith of green mica sandstone - the so-called "Altar". In addition, the northeastern entrance was moved slightly to the side and widened - so that it looked exactly at the sunrise on the summer solstice.\n\nSuddenly, the construction of Stonehenge on this phase remained unfinished. The "blue stones" were soon removed, and the holes beneath them were covered. Giant boulders erected druids to perform ritual ceremonies during the winter and summer solstice.\n\nThere were three separate large "blue stones" here. Survived two - the so-called "Heel" (in the meaning of "last") stone at the northeast entrance outside the shafts and "Stone-Plough" near the same entrance inside the shafts (later he collapsed sideways). Despite the name, with bloody sacrifices, "Stone-Plough" is not connected. Due to weathering, red spots appeared on its side - iron oxides, which gave rise to such gloomy associations. In addition, on the inner side of the northern and southern shafts with unknown targets were piled small burial mounds (without burial), crowned with "blue stones". which gave rise to such gloomy associations.

{wonder_pantocrator_monastery}潘托克特修道院
{wonder_pantocrator_monastery_desc}The monastery of Christ the Pantocrator is a monastic monastery, which played an important role in the spiritual and political life of the Byzantine Empire in the 12th - 15th centuries. The main buildings of the monastery were built before 1136 by the architect Nikifor, commissioned by the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus (1091 - 1143) in the Xth region of Constantinople, northeast of the beginning of the Aqueduct of Valens, on a hill.\n\nAfter the construction began, it was leveled and strengthened by buttresses . The initiative of construction belongs to the wife of John II - Empress Irina, daughter of the Hungarian King Laszlo. The complex of the monastery included the temple of Christ Pantokrator in its northern part and the temple of Our Lady Eleusse in the south, several chapels, as well as a hospital, a nursing home, a psychiatric hospital, a bath, a medical school, several cisterns and cells of the inhabitants. The one-domed church of Christ the Pantocrator is the oldest building of the monastery, but the five-nave temple, with two domes, the temple of the Virgin is much larger in size and was designed to visit the emperor with his retinue.\n\nThe Archangel Michael Chapel was the latest structure of the monastery. The interior and exterior were richly decorated with mosaics depicting mythological and biblical subjects. The first patriarch of his rector, at the behest of the emperor, appointed Joseph Agioglikeria. Initially, the monastery numbered a little over eighty monks, later, at its heyday, the number of inhabitants reached seven hundred. Remaining formally independent, the monastery, in fact, submitted to the emperor and was the burial place of members of the imperial family Comneni. In 1134 the Empress Irina was buried there, in 1143 - the founder of the monastery John II, in 1158 the monastery became the resting place of Irina (Bertha), the wife of Emperor Manuel I (1143 - 1180 gg.), and in 1180 the body of the late Emperor Manuel I was buried there.\n \ In 1143, by order of Emperor Manuel I, the unfortunate pretender to the throne, sevastokrator Isaak, brother of Emperor John II, was imprisoned in the monastery of Christ the Pantocrator.\n\n Among the monastic relics there were: a pillar that scourged Jesus Christ; the fragment of the Anointing Stone on which Joseph of Arimathea washed, dented and clothed in the funeral robes the body of Christ, taken from Ephesus by Manuel I about the year 1170; a pillar, watered with the tears of the apostle Peter; Icon of St. Demetrius of Thessalonica, brought by Manuel I in 1149 from Thessalonica; head of St. Vlasius.\n\nAfter capturing Constantinople by the Latins in 1204, The monastery was seized by the Venetians, who completely looted it, not sparing the imperial graves, they removed even the marble facing of the walls. Among the shrines exported to Italy, there was a unique turning golden iconostasis ("Pala de Oro"). Later, the Venetians converted the monastery into a repository of the remains of Constantinople relics in the city. From 1206 to 1261 years it housed the icon of Our Lady of Odigitria, taken from the temple of Hagia Sophia and returned back in 1261, after the liberation of the city. In the same year, the emperor Michael VIII (1259 - 1282 gg.) Appointed rector of the monastery Theodosius of Villegarduensky, after 1277 became the patriarch of Antioch.\n\nIn the reign of Emperor Andronicus II (1272 - 1328 gg.), The monastery was used as a prison for noble persons. At different times within its walls were imprisoned: Stefan Dekansky, the son of the Serbian King Stephen Uros II, his two sons, and also, probably, blinded by Alexey Filantropin. Since that time, the monastery has again become the imperial burial vault. In 1317, Irina, the second wife of the emperor, was buried there, and then eight more members of the ruling Paleologic dynasty, including the emperors Manuel II (1392-1425) and John VIII (1421-1448). Between 1422 and 1425 years, under the patronage of the courtier and historian George Sfrandzi, Emperor Manuel II appointed the rector of the monastery Makariya Makreya. The monastery then experienced difficult times: the number of monastics was reduced to six people, the buildings were dilapidated and many of them became completely worthless. Through the efforts of Sfranji and Makarii, the structures were partially restored, the number of monks increased to twelve. About this time he took monastic vows in the monastery, and then in 1426 Andrei Paleologus, the despot of Thessalonica, died. In 1431, after the demise of Macarius Macreus, Gerontius, one of the participants of the Ferrara-Florentine Council (1438-1439), became the rector.\n\nIn 1453 the monastery was looted by the Turks, the imperial tombs are desecrated. One of his monks - Gennady, the future Patriarch of Constantinople Gennady II Sholariy (1453-1456), who was soon appointed to the patriarchal pulpit by the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror, was captured in Turkish captivity. Initially, the sultan gave the monastery to the patriarch, but later the Turks turned the temple of Christ Pantocrator into a madrassa. Temple of the Virgin Eleusse was turned into a mosque of Zeyrek Jami, which has survived to our days. The stone of the anointing was returned by the Turks to the building of the former temple of Christ the Pantocrator. In the outdoor mosaic "cosmosco" a small hollow was specially hollowed out and a shrine was thrown into it. There, the Stone is located to this day. Of the other main relics of the Monastery of Christ the Pantocrator, only the head of St. Vlasius, presented by the emperor of the Latin Empire, Baldwin II (1228-1261) to the French King Louis IX, survived, the iconostasis of the Pala de Oro, now in St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice, , who scourged the Savior, stored in the cathedral of St. George the Victorious in Istanbul.

{wonder_notre_dame_reims}兰斯大教堂
{wonder_notre_dame_reims_desc}The Reims Cathedral is one of the most famous Catholic cathedrals - both as a bright artifact of Gothic architecture, and as a symbol of the most important events in European history. From the time of the late Middle Ages to the 19th century, the cathedral was the site of the coronation of virtually all French monarchs.\n\nReems Cathedral has been the site of the coronation of French kings since ancient times. The first temple to the glory of Our Lady was built in the city at the beginning of the V century on the site of the Roman baths. According to legend, in 498, the bishop of Rheims Remigius, an angel who appeared in the image of a dove, brought the Holy Glass-man with oil for the baptism of Chlodvig, the King of Franks from the Merovingian dynasty. It is known that the Christian faith Clovis decided to accept after the victory over the Alemannians and under the influence of Remigius.\n\nIn 816, Louis the Pious in memory of his famous namesake (Clovis - the ancient French modification of the name of Louis) also decided to arrange a coronation ceremony at the cathedral in Reims, thus emphasizing the continuity of royal power in France. The rite of anointing on the throne with the use of oil from the treasured glass, should have resembled the biblical anointing of David Samuel. This fact and the Holy Glassman herself helped the Reims archbishops to gradually achieve that the solemn ceremony was held in their cathedral. As a result, all the French kings from Henry I (1027) to Charles X (1825) were crowned in the Reims cathedral with rare exceptions.\n\nThe construction of the cathedral was conducted continuously in 1211-1275. Thus, he is younger than Notre Dame Cathedral. But finally all the work on the decoration of the temple was completed in 1311. From the architectural point of view, this is one of the most famous examples of Gothic architecture in France. It is decorated with 2303 statues.\n\nAt the time of the centenary war the cathedral was under siege of the British in 1359-60. After the fall of the city, the English owned Reims and the cathedral until 1429, when the city was relieved by Joan of Arc, which allowed July 17, 1429 to conduct the coronation of the Dauphin Karl. In memory of this, the statue of the Maid of Orleans in armor from silvered bronze of the work of Prosper D'Epineus is stored in the cathedral.\n\nIn 1574 the so-called Slavic Reims gospel got into the cathedral - a parchment document considered "a mysterious eastern manuscript". Its first part is written in Cyrillic and contains the reading of the festive Gospels according to the rite of the Orthodox Church. The second part of it is written in the Croatian angular Glagolitic for the performance of Catholic worship in the Slavonic language. And interestingly, it was on this Slavonic manuscript that the French monarchs swore allegiance during the coronation.

{wonder_acropolis_of_athens}雅典卫城
{wonder_acropolis_of_athens_desc}In ancient Greek cities, the acropolis called the sublime and fortified part.\n\nThe first fortifications on a rocky spur of 300 to 130 m, rising on the outskirts of Athens, appeared long before the onset of the classical period. Already in the time of the archaic there were magnificent temples, sculptures, various other shrines. But they were all destroyed by the Persian king Xerxes, who captured Athens in 480-479. BC. This is evidenced in his notes by the "father of history" Herodotus. So the restoration and reconstruction of the Acropolis (or rather the creation here of a completely new architectural ensemble) really occurred already at that time in the history of classical Greece, which is usually called the golden age of Pericles. By this time the Acropolis had already lost its former importance of the main strengthening of Athens. Now the task was to turn it into a religious and artistic center of the city, to crown in the marble a great victory over the Persians, the highest upsurge of Athenian democracy.\n\nThe architectural project of the new Acropolis was developed on the instructions and with the direct participation of the Athenian strategist (commander-in-chief) and the leader of the democratic group Pericles, who after the conclusion of a truce with Sparta got the opportunity to do the construction of the capital. The same construction for 18 years was carried out under the guidance of his friend Phidias - the greatest of Greek sculptors. In general, the creation of this entire architectural complex left the second half of the 5th century. BC. At the same time, Pericles and Fidia's plan was fully justified.\n\nThe main attraction of the whole ensemble was and remains the Parthenon - the largest and most famous structure in this ensemble, which is also called the "anthem" of ancient Greece and "the beauty of simplicity". This temple was also dedicated to the goddess Athena. But this time she performed in the guise of Athena-Parthenos or Athena-Virgo. Hence the name of the temple. Built by the architects Iktin and Callikrat, the Parthenon, combining the Doric and Ionian orders and perfectly fitting into the surrounding countryside, was remarkable for its remarkable harmony. This applies to its steps, the outer colonnade, the pediments, the friezes and the metopes - square slabs with sculptures, many of which were created by Fidium. The building of the Parthenon was erected from local white marble, but then painted, inside there were two more porticos with columns. Here on the high pedestal stood a 12-meter statue of Athena-Virgo of the same Phidias. This statue was chrysoelephantine, that is, made of ivory and gold, and not from bronze and marble, as usual.\n\nIn the 5th century the Parthenon became the church of Our Lady, the statue of Athena Parthenos was transported to Constantinople. After the conquest of Greece by the Turks (in the 15th century), the temple was turned into a mosque, to which the minarets were attached, then to the arsenal; The Erechtheion became a harem of the Turkish pasha, the temple of Nicky Ateros was dismantled, a bastion wall was built from its blocks.

Prince Andrey conceived it not only as the main temple of his principality, his cultural, political and religious center, but also as the main temple of all Rus, Kiev's independent metropolis.\n\nThe architecture of the temple for a long time was decisive for Russian architecture for several centuries ahead. The beauty of the temple was combined with the refinement and pomp of the interior.\n\nThe facades were decorated with complex pilasters with Corinthian capitals, and horizontally dismembered into two tiers with an arched frieze. The walls and the vault of the church were painted with frescoes. The floor was covered with a mosaic of colored majolica and copper plated plates. The light of the gold and silver chandeliers that illuminated the Assumption Cathedral was reflected in the gilded gilded slabs of the floor, as if in a huge mirror. On the hill above the altar, the prince built a platform of gold and silver, designed for reading sermons and Holy Scripture.

Strict proportions of the archway, blocked by a powerful semicircular vault, and the special grace of a small church on top gave the building a majestic character, well suited to its purpose. The date of the completion of the gate dates back to 1158, the end of construction - April 26, 1164, when the gate church was consecrated.\n\nAt the time of Andrei Bogolyubsky's rule, the city was surrounded by a long rampart and had seven entrance gates (except the Golden Gate, the Copper, the Irinin, or Orininy, Silver, Ivanovo, Commercial and Volga)\n\nThis were the most important gates of the city in the 12th-13th centuries. Ipatiev Chronicle reports that the prince of their "commit" gold, bearing in mind that they were covered with sheets of gilded copper, brightly shining in the sun and amazed imagination of contemporaries. Close to the gate from the north and south adjoined bulk shafts with deep moats from the outside. Through the ditches from the gate passed a bridge that led out of town. The height of the arch reached 14 meters. The massive oak gates of the gate, hanging on wrought hinges, adjoined the arch bridge, which is still preserved today. At the top of this lintel was a wooden flooring, which served as an additional battleground.\n\nThe entrance to the site was through a doorway in the southern wall, in the thickness of which passed a stone staircase with a creeping box vault. At the same level from the opposite side of the stairs was the exit to the southern line of earthen ramparts. From the north to the ramparts there was a passage directly from the platform through the door in the wall. The ladder in the south wall led further to the upper battleground, which had battlements in the form of loopholes. In the center of this site was built the gate white stone church of the Robe of the Mother of God. Most likely, it represented a rather slender temple of Yuri Dolgoruky, already familiar in the buildings: square in terms of four-pillared with three altar apses with internal and external shoulder blades on the walls, three arched portals, a cylindrical drum and a modest decoration in the form of a decorative girdle walking in the middle of the altitude facade.\n\nLegend # 1: when the works were coming to an end, and the scaffolding was dismantled, The arches suddenly collapsed and buried under them 12 people. None of the eyewitnesses doubted that people were crushed to death under the weight of stones, but Andrei Bogolyubsky ordered to bring the miraculous icon of the Mother of God and turned to the heavenly patron with a prayer for the unfortunate. The blockage was cleared and the people lying under it were found alive and unharmed. In honor of the miracle that happened, Andrei Bogolyubsky ordered to build a tiny white-stone chapel of the Robe of the Mother of God on the Golden Gate.\n\nLegenda # 2. During the construction of the Golden Gate, a partial collapse of the arch occurred. Prince Andrew Bogolyubsky ordered a thanksgiving service, since all miraculously survived, and replaced the brigade of builders. According to legend, they were Italian masters, who arrived from the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, with whom the prince led a friendship. They completed the construction of the gate. Their work so pleased the prince that he left them to build other stone buildings in the new capital - the Assumption and Dmitrievsky cathedrals, as well as the residence of the prince and the Church of the Intercession on the Nerl in Bogolyubovo.\n\nIn 1238, the hordes of Mongol-Tatars, Russian cities, came to Vladimir. The townspeople prepared themselves for defense and hid all valuable relics in case the enemy did break through. The idea was a success: golden gates of the Golden Gate have not been found until now. approached Vladimir.

{wonder_eletskii_monastery_desc}The phenomenon of the ancient miracle-working Elets Icon of the Mother of God took place on February 6, 1060, during the reign of Chernigov, the grandson of St. Vladimir the Equal-to-the-Apostles, Svyatoslav Yaroslavich, who created the monastery on the site of the icon.\n\nThe prince of Kiev is Svyatoslav Yaroslavich. In 1069 in this monastery lived the "father of Russian monasticism" the Monk Anthony of Caves. In the middle of the 12th century, the 25-meter-high Assumption Cathedral was built in the place where the holy icon was found.\n\nWriting the Skarbnitsa, Archimandrite Ioanniki Golyatovsky sent to Moscow hieromonk Sylvester Khmelevich and deacon Gennady to inquire about the Mother of God Yelets, why she so called. The aged prince Nikita Ivanovich Odoevsky, a descendant of Chernigov prince Svyatoslav Yaroslavich, told them: " We were fond of grandfathers and great-grandfathers of ours, that near Chernigov on the tree spruce is the image of the Blessed Virgin. Because the church there is called the Mother of God Eletskaya, which is named after the Elina of the Album of the Mother of God Eletskaya, because the image of the Blessed Virgin is on the firs of the album on Elina.\n\nIn 1239, during the Mongol-Tatar invasion of Khan Batu, the cathedral and monastery was plundered According to legend, at the time of the conquerors' attack, the ancient icon of the Eletsk Mother of God was hidden inside the church wall, and later it was again placed in the Assumption Cathedral. "Golyatovsky in Skarbnitsa notes:" The Blessed Virgin on a tree zko Chernigov znaydeny, z Chernigov to Moscow under the hour of war is postponed, because now in Chernigov, that image is not known. " Filaret Gumilevsky in his description of the city of Kharkov claimed that "in 1579 the holy icon was taken by Prince Baryatinsky and remained in the house of Baryatinsky, the descendants of Chernigov prince Svyatoslav Yaroslavich, in the form of an inheritance." And then, "in 1687, okolnichy, Prince Daniel Baryatinsky, commander of the regiments of Novgorod, under the command of Prince Vasily Golitsyn, while on a campaign against the Crimea, on his way back from the campaign became ill in Kharkov and being near death gave the former with him in the campaign of St.. Elets Icon of the Mother of God in the Kharkov Assumption Cathedral. "\n\nIn 1445 Chernigov was owned by Prince Ivan Mozhaisky, who began the restoration of Chernigov shrines. At the same time Eletskii monastery was repaired. At the beginning of the 16th century, following the results of the Russian-Lithuanian war, Chernigov is a part of the Moscow principality. After, as in 1618 Chernigov turns out to be "under Poland," the monastery is ruined again, the monks flee, and the Assumption Cathedral is destroyed. After 1623 the Polish authorities transfer the monastery to the Uniates, who repair it and restore it. The Uniate Abbot of the Yeletsky Monastery Cyril Tranquillion-Stavrovetsky prints in 1646 the first book in Chernigov - his work Perlon is very valuable.\n\nIn 1649 the Poles were completely expelled from Chernigov, and the monastery again becomes Orthodox. Among his abbots there were such church and cultural figures as Demetrius of Rostov, Lazar Baranovich, Theodosius of Chernigov, Ioannicius of Galyatovsky, and others.

{wonder_transfiguration_cathedral}神迹大教堂
{wonder_transfiguration_cathedral_desc}The Transfiguration Cathedral is a five-domed eight-storied church in Chernigov. The oldest surviving monument of ancient Russian architecture.\n\nThe founder of the Spassky Cathedral was one of the most famous Chernigov princes, the son of Vladimir the Great and Yaroslav's brother Mstislav Brave. Since 990 he reigned in Tmutarakan, and in 1024, after defeating the army of his brother Yaroslav the Wise, he took the prince's throne in Chernigov. Mstislav for his life became famous as an outstanding commander and undefeated warrior. The chroniclers glorified his victory in a duel with the Kasogian (kasogi - tribe from northern Transcaucasia) Prince Rededey. For some time, Mstislav was at war with Yaroslav, but not for the principality of Kiev, but for Chernigov (because Yaroslav wanted to take him to his state). But later the brothers reconciled, and in 1030 they marched in a joint campaign to Red Russia (Galicia). Red Russia was then annexed to the Russian state, and Mstislav, returning to Chernigov, began the construction of a large cathedral.\n\nConstruction was slow. Mstislav did not live to see it completed - in 1036 he "went hunting, fell ill and died." At that time, the walls reached about three meters in height ("you can get so much by sitting on a horse"), but the prince was buried in an unfinished church. Well, Chernigov moved without a fight to Yaroslav the Wise.\n\nThe master's cathedral, invited from Tmutarakan, was built. They imitated the construction not only of the Byzantine tradition, but also of the traditions of Asia Minor and Transcaucasia. Perhaps this explains the form of the cathedral and its planning and spatial solution. And it is unique, because it combines a typical Byzantine crusade with elements of Romanesque basilicas. None of the other ancient Russian churches had such planning.\n\nThe Spassky Cathedral was completed after the Chernigov princedom entered the Russian state of Yaroslav and under the subsequent reign of his son Svyatoslav, who was originally Chernigov and then the Grand Prince of Kiev. Svyatoslav Yaroslavich was also buried in the Spassky Cathedral (in 1076)\n\nIn Chernihiv-Seversk land there was no church more majestic than the Savior Cathedral. Immediately after the construction it became the cathedral of the Chernigov diocese and performed this function for almost nine centuries. In the temple, the wife and son of Prince Mstislav, princes: Gleb Svyatoslavovich (1078), Oleg Svyatoslavovich (1115), Vladimir Davidovich (1161), Svyatoslav Olgovich (1165), Vsevolod Svyatoslavich (1196) of the Chernihiv bishops: Lazar Baranovich and Ambrose Dubkevich. Also, Chernigov's saint Igor Olgovich slept here.\n\nIt was originally surrounded by chapel-tombs, in the north to the vestibule was a round tower with a staircase to the choir, and from the south was attached a three-pagan one-door church-baptismal. But in 1239, during the Mongol-Tatar invasion, the cathedral was badly damaged - the vaults and domes fell.\n\nIt was rebuilt in the Cossack period in the 17th century. Then they built up the apses and built baroque domes.

{castel_sant_angelo_desc}The Castle of the Holy Angel is a Roman architectural monument, also known as the Mausoleum of Hadrian, sometimes called the Sad Castle, which is a tall, cylindrical building in Adriano Park on the banks of the Tiber. Originally built by the order of the Roman emperor Adrian as a mausoleum, and also as a tomb for other emperors, the last of which was buried Caracalla, later used by the Roman popes as a fortress from barbarian raids.\n\nAfter the fortress was captured by the barbarians, Sant'Angelo was completely ruined. The little thing that remained, later was taken to the hands of the Vatican. After that, the fortress became a castle, large-scale reconstruction was carried out outside and inside. The former premises with the urns of Emperor Hadrian and his descendants turned into luxurious papal apartments, and on the lower levels of the castle was a prison, one of the most strict in Rome. In general, the castle of Sant'Angelo was an impregnable papal fortress during the Renaissance. This fortress inspired the Romans with all the boundless power of the Holy See and was an inseparable attribute of papal authority

{vatikan}圣.彼得大教堂
{vatikan_desc}St. Peter's Basilica (Latin Basilica Sancti Petri, Italy Basilica di San Pietro, St. Peter's Basilica) is a Catholic cathedral, the central and largest building of the Vatican, the largest historical Christian church in the world. One of the four patriarchal basilicas of Rome and the ceremonial center of the Roman Catholic Church. Occupies the first place in the list of seven pilgrimage basilica of Rome [1]. Over its creation several generations of great masters worked: Bramante, Raphael, Michelangelo, Bernini. The capacity is about 60 000 people+400 thousand people in the square.\n Once on the place where now stands the Cathedral of St. Petra, there were gardens of the circus of Nero (from it there was an obelisk from Heliopolis, which to this day stands on St. Peter's Square). The first basilica was built in 326, in the reign of the first Christian emperor Constantine. The altar of the cathedral was placed over the grave, from the second century considered to be the burial place of St. Peter, who in 66 died martyrdom in the circus of Nero. In the second cathedral in 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charles with the emperor of the West. In the XV century, the basilica, which had existed for eleven centuries, threatened to collapse, and under Nicholas V it began to expand and rebuild. This question was fundamentally decided by Julius II, who ordered the building of an enormous new cathedral on the site of the ancient basilica, which would eclipse both pagan churches and existing Christian churches, thereby strengthening the papal state and spreading the influence of Catholicism.\n Almost all major architects in Italy queue participated in the design and construction of the Cathedral of St. Petra. In 1506 the project of architect Donato Bramante was approved, in accordance with which they began to erect a centric structure in the form of a Greek cross (with equal parties). After the death of Bramante, the construction was headed by Rafael Santi, who returned to the traditional form of the Latin cross (with an extended fourth side), then Baldassare Peruzzi, stopped on a centric structure, and Antonio da Sangallo, who chose the basilic form.\n Finally, in 1546 the management of the works was commissioned by Michelangelo. He returned to the idea of ​​a central dome structure, but his project envisaged the creation of a multi-column entrance port from the east side (in the ancient basilica of Rome, as well as in ancient temples, the entrance was from the east, and not from the west). All the supporting structures of Michelangelo made more massive and distinguished the main space. He erected a drum of the central dome, but the dome itself was completed after his death (1564) by Giacomo della Porta, which gave him more elongated outlines. Of the four small domes provided for by the Michelangelo project, the architect Vignola raised only two. Most architectural forms in the form, as they were conceived by Michelangelo, have been preserved from the altar, the western side.

Although sheep breeding was common throughout Europe, not all wool was valued in the same way: therefore large Flemish and Tuscan fabric manufacturers imported raw materials from Provence, North Africa, Spain and England.\n Wool is removed, degreased, combed.

In small Edgor there is everything you need: water, food, potions, wonderful herbs, aromas of fresh air reclaimed by oriental spices. In the center of the tent is placed a bronze cauldron in which large red glowing stones are placed, on which medicinal herbs and spices are applied, and then poured with a small amount of water to produce steam. Thus, a small healing sauna was obtained, which produced a healing effect on the patient's health.

The first medical institution, where students could upgrade their skills, observe patients and perform operations under the supervision of experienced doctors, was the academy in Gandishapur, in the Sassanid Empire (in the south of Iran). Only in 1036g. This structure was copied in the Romene Empire with the advent of Xenon Pantocrator. Since that moment, "xenodochion" begins to develop, in contrast to Western European hospitals.

{public_baths_c_rus}俄罗斯浴室
{public_baths_c_rus_desc}Traditional Russian baths (rustic) are divided into:\n - Baths heated "in black" have an open hearth, which heats not only the stones, but also the walls of the bath. The smoke from the hearth comes out through the door or the vent in the ceiling. Usually in it there is a heater from boulders-pellets and a boiler for hot water. It is heated by firewood, preferably hardwood (for example, birch). With an incorrect furnace, the sauna "bitter". The wood inside the sauna is very hot, as a result, the walls of the bath are of a dark color, but this also serves to disinfect the bathhouse. Before use, it is necessary to aerate from the smoke and wash it from the soot of the shelves.\n - Baths heated "in white", there are different designs. In such a bath there must be a stone, brick or metal oven with a tank for heating water. Such a bath requires more wood for accumulation, but it is much easier and more pleasant to operate. Such a design has also modern individual baths.\n - Bath inside the Russian oven. The furnace is heated, water is heated in cast iron. After the furnace from the hearth, the ash is removed and straw is poured. The heat rushes into the corner of the stove. After that, you can wash yourself, climb into the oven and even carefully bathe the broom, so as not to pull on the soot. Probably from here comes the Ukrainian name of the bath - "laznia". climbed into the oven and even carefully bathed a broom, so as not to pull on the soot.

{kiev_church_tithes}基輔什一税大教堂
{kiev_church_tithes_desc}The tithe church is the first stone church of Kievan Rus. It was built on the spot where, according to the order of Prince Vladimir, the pagan god Perun was sacrificed to two Christians - the infant John and his father Fyodor.\n\nThe church was built in honor of the Holy Virgin in 986-996, in the era of the reign Vladimir the Great, who donated a tenth of his income to the erection and maintenance of the church.\n\nThe first building by the type of the Byzantine basilica was built of local stone - it had a size of 32 by 42 meters. In it, six tiers were arranged, and the structure itself was in the form of a Byzantine cross. In the first temple there were arranged three limits - the main throne was dedicated to the Nativity of the Virgin, and the other two - Nicholas and St. Vladimir. It was in this church that St. Vladimir was originally buried (his tomb was discovered during archaeological excavations). During the existence of the first building of the temple, despite the fact that it was built of stone, burned several times (in 1017, 1203). It was this temple that became the last point of the defense of Kiev during the siege of the city by the horde Batu and collapsed during the storm, buried under its walls defenders of the city in 1240. During the years of its existence, before the construction of the cathedral of St. Sophia, this church remained the burial-vault of the grand-ducal family. After the construction of the church, the remains of St. Olga, the grandmother of Vladimir the Great, his wife, the Greek princess Anna and some other descendants of the Baptist of Russia were transferred to him.

{wonder_polotsk_stsophia_cathedral}波洛茨克.索菲亚大教堂
{wonder_polotsk_stsophia_cathedral_desc}Polotsk Sophia Cathedral was built between 1044-1066 years. The prince of Polotsk at this time was the legendary Vseslav the Wizard. The place for the temple was chosen beautiful - on the right bank of the Dvina, in the very place where the river Polota flows into it. From which the name of the city went - Polotsk.\n\nThe Sofia city in Polotsk once again stressed the high position of the Polotsk principality, it was the third such cathedral in the East Slavic lands - after Kiev and Novgorod. The temple looked impressive and resembled a white ship floating above the Dvina.\n\nSophia's construction in Polotsk was connected with the transfer of the city center from the old settlement. The cathedral was similar to similar cathedrals in Kiev and Novogorod - the five-nave cross-domed church had a dedicated altar part in the central apse with a synthron and a dome with a diameter of 5.85 meters.\n\nThe baptistery and the staircase tower to the princely choirs were built around the temple. Annals indicate that Polotsk Sophia had seven domes. The main dome was placed in the center, it was surrounded by four smaller domes. The baptismal hall and the staircase tower also had their domes. Despite the similarity with the Kiev and Novgorod temples, Polotsk Sophia had its own characteristics. For example, there were no galleries in it, besides the temple had three apses, not five.\n\nThe temple in Polotsk was painted only with frescoes, in this he repeated Novgorod's Sofia. The Kiev Cathedral boasted also a mosaic. There is an opinion that all three churches were built by masters, invited from Constantinople. St. Sophia Cathedral became the center of public and cultural life of ancient Polotsk. There was a library and an archive, there was a treasury and a magistrate. In addition, religious shrines were kept in the church, and ambassadors from other lands were also received here. Sometimes in the official documents, instead of the name of the city, the name "Saint Sofia" was used.\n\nThe cathedral was a difficult fate, it burned many times and collapsed. After 1569, the Orthodox Cathedral was given to the Uniates. The famous Uniat Josaphat Kuntsevich also had a relationship with the Polotsk cathedral. He rebuilt and rebuilt the temple after the fire of 1607. During the Russian-Polish war, Polotsk was taken by the troops of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich. Sophia returned the Orthodox believers, but in 1667 it again became Uniat.\n\nThe tragic disaster occurred during the Northern War - St. Sophia was blown up. Peter I occupied the city and gave the temple back to the Orthodox community. Orthodox believers refused to accept it, because they feared repression. Then there are several versions of the development of events. According to one of them, the drunk Peter I, together with the soldiers, invaded the temple, which was then Uniate. The king demanded that the keys be given away from the king's gates, because the relics of Josaphat Kuntsevich were kept there. When the monks refused, he personally killed the abbot and four monks and ordered their bodies to be thrown into the Dvina.\n\n Only in the 1740s the restoration of the cathedral began. He was led by the Uniate priest Florian Grebnitsky. On the grounds of the walls that remained after the explosion, a twin-towered bisilic was built in the style of the Vilno baroque. It was a completely different temple, simply built on the "bones" of the old Sofia.

{palazzodeinormanni}诺曼尼宫
{palazzodeinormanni_desc}The Palazzo Normandi (literally the Norman Palace) or the Palazzo Reale (literally the Royal Palace) is the former residence of Sicilian kings and viceroys, located on the outskirts of the historic part of Palermo. The most famous part of the palace is the Palatine Chapel.\n\nThe first buildings on the site of the Palazzo Normanni belonged to the Phoenicians, then there were ancient Roman fortifications. In the 9th century, the Arabs, who captured Palermo in 875, founded their fortress, known as the Palace of the Emirs, on the site of ancient ruins. In the Arab era, the building was one of the fortresses that controlled Palermo, and the emir's residence was located in the city itself - in the current quarter of Kalsa.\n\nIn 1072, the Normans took possession of Palermo, and Robert Guiscard arranged his residence in the Palace of the Emirs. His nephew Roger II turned the former Arab fortress into a royal palace. At Roger II, four towers were added to the palace: the Pisa (or Saint Ninfa), the Red (italian Torre Rossa), the Greek and Joarea, with his son Wilhelm I the Evil - the Kirimby tower. Of the listed towers, so far only the first has survived. Under Roger II, a private royal chapel was built and consecrated in the palace - the Palatine Chapel. The heyday of the Norman Palace is associated with the names of the grandson of Roger II - Friedrich II, under which the palace became the imperial residence, and Manfred. After the death of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, Palermo lost its capital status, and until the 16th century the palace was an ordinary fortress.

The name was given in honor of the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad Fatima Zahra. The mosque was considered the official mosque of the Fatimids and the actual center of the Shia call.\n\nIn 975, lectures on the basics of Shi'ism were given in the mosque. In 988, Minister Yakub bin Kalyas set up a curriculum, recruited a group of teachers and attracted students.\n\nThanks to its location (Cairo is at the crossroads of Asia and Africa), many foreigners came to study at Al-Azhar. Initially, the training was conducted directly in the courtyard of the mosque, but because of the large number of out-of-town students special residential premises (rivak) were built for them. The university system of al-Azhar included the use of the works of visiting professors and scholarships for talented students.\n\nAt time, the university began to switch to mixed Shiite-Sunni theology.\n\nAfter the overthrow of the Fatimid power in Cairo by Saladin in 1171, al-Azhar lost and was relegated to the rank and file of the Sunni mosque with the educational center of the Shafi'i madhhab. Books from the rich collection of al-Azhar (their number is estimated from 120 thousand to 2 million) were sold or destroyed. On the other hand, Saladin in al-Azhar was taught by the scientist and healer Abdul-Latif ibn Yusuf al-Baghdadi and the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, who lectured on medicine and astronomy.\n\nThus, in the walls of al-Azhar, the representatives of four Sunni mazhabs, Shiites and later Sufi schools.

Religious orders not only were large landowners who had a steady income from their vineyards, but also performed a number of public functions that required the possession of large stocks of wine. Travelers who often stayed and rested in monasteries should be fed and provided with wine, and the abbots often held festivities on which wine was served to the table, moreover, wine was included in the daily diet of monks and nuns.

{courts_desc}The barbarous peoples who settled in the territory of the former Roman Empire preserved their legal customs. They were transmitted verbally, from generation to generation, and changed very slowly. With the emergence of the barbarian states, it became necessary to fix their customs in writing. This was prompted by the immediate neighborhood with the Romans, who knew the letter and had written laws. Therefore, in the V-IX centuries. In the barbarian kingdoms appeared collections of laws that regulated the punishment for the relevant violations or crimes. The most famous "Burgundy Truth", "Salic Truth", "Saxon Truth".

{courts+1_desc}There was no one and equal justice for all. The chief judge was usually the king. But on the ground judicial functions were often carried out by his commissioners. For example, in the Frankish state, the counts presided over the court sessions. Every social class had its own courts. The affairs of clergymen were examined in church courts. Conflicts and disputes between the townspeople were decided by the city tribunal. Dependent peasants were subject to the seignior's trial. The fate of a noble vassal had the right to be decided only by the court, where the assessors were equal to him in status. The penal system of the Middle Ages was very cruel. It was based on corporal punishment, which resulted in injuries. Even those sentenced to be executed often were tortured and tortured. The attitude to the suspect during the court session and even the execution of the sentence depended on his status. The venerable knight or citizen was trusted and given the opportunity to take an oath of purification to defend against the charge. While violations of common people were taken for granted. Ordinary people were found guilty and almost immediately executed, usually through hanging or spinning. The nobility was executed by chopping off the head. The executioners were executed by professional executioners. If it was difficult to establish the guilt, then the law of God's judgment came into force. Opponents were assigned fights. It was believed that the "heavenly forces" would ensure victory to the innocent, and the offender would be punished. If they accused a woman, any knight could intercede for her. At the heart of God's judgment were laid the religious beliefs,

{courts+2_desc}One of the varieties of God's court was the hordes of testing by fire, water, and the use of other tortures to establish guilt. During the fire test, the suspect had to carry barefire iron with bare hands or walk around with his blindfold on hot coal barefoot. If he sustained all these tests, did not receive any special injuries, or healed his wounds within three days, he was justified. Another way of establishing the truth was to immerse your hand in boiling water. For the servants of the church, a test was dedicated to the consecrated bread. It was believed that the guilty must suffocate them. By the way, the señor could easily avoid testing with iron or water, sending instead of himself one of the servants. X century. From the Law on Orders (England). And if the horde is carried out by water, then let this water be boiling, besides, The boiler must be iron or copper, lead or clay. And if the charge is simple, then the hand to remove the stone must be immersed in boiling water to the wrist. And if the charge is triple, then up to the elbow. And the accused let him drink the consecrated water, then let him water his hand, which he must carry with his ordeal (square iron), and so let him begin the test. And his hand should be wrapped, and on the third day it was examined to see if the hand was burned, that is, whether the suspect is guilty or not.

{kladbische_middle_eastern_desc}Muslim cemeteries are a special territory (a piece of land) for the burial of the deceased who adhered to the life of the Islamic religion; it does not matter whether they are racial or national.
A feature of Muslim cemeteries is that they, as a rule, are located outside the village and surrounded by a fence that serves as a fence against animals. According to the Shari'ah, it is permissible to install gravestones on graves to ensure that people know that this is a grave, and did not walk on it, and also to find out the grave of a loved one. This is indicated by the following hadeeth, in which it is reported that when Usman ibn Mazun was buried, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) commanded one man to bring a stone, but he could not. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) went and himself brought this stone and, placing it at the head of the bed, said: "Thanks to this, I will recognize my brother's grave and will bury here those who die from among my family members."

{kladbische_nativeindian_desc}A special place among pagan rituals was occupied by the burial ceremony. Over a long period, the ratio of the two main types of burial ritual - the corpse and burning - was highly variable. The primitive burial of the corpses that were artificially given the position of the embryo in the womb was associated with the belief in a second birth after death. Therefore, the deceased was buried and prepared for this second birth. Soon a completely new burial ceremony sprang up, born of new views about the soul of man, which does not incarnate again in any other creature (beast, man, bird ...), but moves to the airspace of the sky. The ancestor's fork split into two: on the one hand, a weightless, invisible soul joined the heavenly powers, so important for those farmers, which did not have artificial irrigation, but everything depended on the heavenly water. On the other hand, benevolent ancestors, "grandfathers," had to be associated with the land that yields the harvest. This was achieved by digging the burned ashes into the ground and building over the burial of the model of the house, the "house".

Each tribe had its own gods, to whom they prayed. There was never a single idea of ​​the gods in the pre-Christian world, as there was no single state, the tribes, although united in a union, were still different tribes, they were not the same in their beliefs. The Gentiles had quite a few rites for all occasions. A special place among them was occupied by the burial ceremony. For a long time there was a fluctuation between the two main types of burial ritual: burial and burning.

This was due to the belief in a second birth after death. Soon a new burial ceremony sprang up, born of a new worldview about the soul of a person who does not incarnate in any other being, but moves to heaven.

Therefore, it is difficult to believe in the interpretation of the excessive cruelty of pagan peoples. The question of the polysemy of many cultural manifestations within paganism is likely to indicate the existence of general theological views of Indo-Europeans.

The ensemble also includes a leaning tower and a baptistery. The ensemble was created from the 11th to the 13th centuries, during the heyday of Pisa, and is one of the most significant monuments of Romanesque architecture in Italy. \n\nConstruction began in 1063 by the architect Buscheto di Giovanni Giudice with funds collected by Pisa as a tribute from the Balearic Islands ... As conceived by Buscheto, the cathedral was supposed to include elements of various styles, Byzantine, Lombard and even Islamic, which symbolized the scope of the Pisa trade. The resulting style is known in literature as the Pisa Romanesque style. Around the same time, St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice was under construction, and one of Busceto's tasks was to build a cathedral no worse than that of Venetian competitors. \n\nThe cathedral was consecrated in 1118 by Pope Gelasius II, who himself came from the Pisa family of Caetano. In the first half of the 12th century, the architect Rainaldo was commissioned to design the facade of the cathedral. The facade was created by a team of sculptors led by Guillelmo and Biduino.

The top of the rock has been inhabited since the Late Bronze Age, around 800 BC. e. The first mention of fortifications called Din Eidyn or Stronghold of Eidyn is given in Welsh epic poetry around 600 AD. e. The first definite evidence of the existence of the castle is associated with the reign of King David I, who convened meetings of the nobility and clergy in the castle since 1139. \n\nThe castle gives the impression of an absolutely impregnable fortress. Three sides of the fortress are protected by sheer cliffs, and access to the castle was limited by a steep road on the fourth (eastern) side. The only way to get to the road is through the esplanade - a long and empty slope that is completely shot from the fortress.

{alcazar_of_seville}塞维利亚宫殿群
{alcazar_of_seville_desc}The Alcazar of Seville is the most important monumental architectural complex of Seville, whose origins date back to the Muslim period of domination on the Iberian Peninsula. It is a series of palaces created at different times and in different styles, surrounded by luxurious gardens. The heart of the complex is the palace of King Pedro I, who ordered to build his royal residence on the site of an ancient Moorish castle. \n\nSince the end of the 11th century. to this day, his history has known the most different periods, he witnessed the development of Seville, the fusion of different cultures, peoples and rulers, capturing all this in his walls covered with gray centuries. The history of its origin is closely connected with such rulers as Al-Mutamid, Fernando III, King of Castile Alfonso X and, of course, Pedro I the Cruel. 
Its construction began during the reign of the Arab conquerors, and continued already when the administration of Seville passed to the Catholic kings, for whom for seven centuries the palace in Seville remained the official residence. \n\nMuslim and Arab architects, thanks to their work and decorative finishes, created a magnificent a piece of architecture that has become a fine example of Mudejar architecture. \n\nIn 712, Seville was conquered by the Arab conquerors. And since 720, in order to assert their rule, they begin to build palaces on this land for their leaders. In 884, the first fortress they built helped stop them even from the Viking invasion. 
And soon after the royal Moorish dynasty of the Almohads gained control of Seville in 1161, they ordered the construction of their official residence on the site of an ancient fort built during the Roman Empire and later the Visigoths. During their reign, the main palace-fortress, known as Al-Mutamid, was built, a luxurious row of baths, formidable watchtowers and a beautiful large mosque. \n\nAmong the first buildings in the new palace complex at this time, there remained the House of Princes, erected back in the 9th century ... from the Plaza de Triomphe to the Barrio de Santa Cruz. The early Islamic palace is the same age as the Alhambra in Granada. In the XI century. it was expanded by the Arab emirs, in the XII century. an Alcazar or Blessing Palace is attached to it. Today, the Patio del Yeso, the Hall of Justice, the Patio del Crusero, the Courtyard of the House of Nay and the monumental walls surrounding it have survived here from the first Islamic palace. \n\nAfter the Reconquista - the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula from the Arab conquerors by Catholic kings, and the capture of the city by King Fernando III in 1248, his son Alfonso XI the Wise carried out the first reforms here, ordering in 1254 to build three large halls in the Gothic style in the main palace. \n\nIn 1364, King Pedro I the Cruel of Castile commissioned his subjects to build for him the royal palace on the site of the old Moorish Al-Mutamid, which will later be named after him. This palace will be the first that was not protected by defensive walls. And it is here that the Mudejar style will first appear, striking with magnificent ornamentation, and the interior decoration of the palace, distinguished by its wealth. \n\nBeing a huge lover of the architecture of Arab countries, the king invites masters from the Arab families of Granada and Toledo to build the palace. That is why fragments of Moorish buildings from Cordoba, Seville and Valencia were used in the palace style. \n\nArchitects and artisans from all over Andalusia managed to create here not only a real palace from the tale of a thousand and one nights and arrange around it a series of courtyards that differ in those or other unique decorative elements, but also a luxurious interior in the Mudejar style. After the completion of construction, the king settled here with his beloved. But in 1366 a civil war broke out between Pedro I and his brother Henry II, which ended only with the death of Pedro in 1369. Pedro I's palace is today considered one of the best examples of Moorish architecture in Spain. \n\nA little later, the Spanish monarchs Isabella I and Charles V added new buildings to the palace. A Gothic chapel, Patio de la Monteria and numerous themed gardens appeared here. Over the years, other monarchs have continued to expand the palace, resulting in a variety of different complexes representing a wide variety of architectural styles. \n\nThroughout history, the Alcazar has been the scene of several events associated with the Spanish crown. In 1477, King Ferdinand II of Aragon arrived in Seville with his wife, Queen of Castile Isabella I, and a year later, on June 14, 1478, his second son, Prince Juan, was born here. In 1526, the wedding of King Charles V of Spain and Isabella of Portugal took place in the Alcazar. The palace became the birthplace of the Infanta of Spain Marie Antoinette (1729-1785), daughter of King Philip V of Spain and Queen Elizabeth Farnese. \n\nIn 1823, during the military uprising, the royal family, led by King Ferdinand VII, lived in Seville in within two months, and the Alcazar again becomes the main royal residence. Here, on April 17, 1823, in the city was born the baby Heinrich de Bourbon, king of the two Sicilies, the son of Francisco de Paula de Bourbon and Louise Carlotta of Bourbon-Both Sicilies. A few days after his birth, King Ferdinand VII bestowed the title of Duke of Seville on the infant.

{cattedrale_nidaros_desc}The Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim is the most famous and beautiful Gothic-Romanesque church in Norway. The seat of the Norwegian archdiocese, founded in 1152, was housed in this cathedral for many years. The cathedral is dedicated to the Trinity and is an important pilgrimage center in northern Europe. The first coronations of the kings of Norway took place in Bergen and Oslo. Nidaros Cathedral became the site of coronations only after 1400, when Norway united with Denmark. \n\nKing Olaf II Haraldsson, who died in the Battle of Stikleshtad in 1030, was buried under the altar of the cathedral. One year and five days after his death, Olaf was declared a saint. His remains are enclosed in a shrine adorned with pearls. Work on the construction of the cathedral began in 1070. and ended only in 1300. The cathedral suffered several fires in 1327 and 1531.

The city owes its significance for Catholic Europe primarily to the acquisition of the relics of St. Jacob. According to believers, after the martyrdom of the apostle in 44, his remains were put into a boat and launched along the waves of the Mediterranean Sea. Miraculously, this boat sailed to Spain, where the saint had preached earlier, and was thrown ashore at the mouth of the Ulya River (where the city would appear later).

{castello_cesarea}凯撒利亚城堡
{castello_cesarea_desc}Caesarea (Caesarea) has been an important economic and strategic center for centuries. At the time of the emergence of the Hittite state, there were already two settlements here - Kanesh, the capital of the kingdom of the same name (according to scientists, the most powerful in Anatolia), and Karum, which was founded by Assyrian merchants as a bazaar, one of the oldest in the world. On the site of Caesarea, the settlement of Mazaka was originally located, which reached its peak already under the Phrygians. The Romans renamed it after the emperor Tiberius. It was the main city of the Roman province of Cappadocia and in the 3rd century AD. its population numbered approximately 400,000. \nThe historian Strabo describes a city located in an unsuitable area: lack of water, with rocky and uncultivated land. The city was located not far from an active volcano in those years and there was a constant danger of another eruption. Nearby were the sources of the Euphrates River, which created wetlands in the lowlands. \n\nIn 370, the theologian Saint Basil the Great was elected bishop of the city. (329-379), who founded the Basilian monastery and first developed the rules of living together for monks. Between the 7th and 9th centuries, Caesarea suffered Arab invasions. Emperor Justinian built a powerful citadel in the center of the city from black volcanic rock. In the 11th century, a colony of Armenians, driven out of their native land by the Seljuks, found refuge in Caesarea. \n\n In 1067 the city was captured by the Seljuk Sultan Alp Arslan and became the capital of the powerful emirate Danishmend.

{sannicola}圣.尼古拉大教堂
{sannicola_desc}The basilica was built after a group of merchants (who went to the city of Mira, Anatolia) arrived in Bari to retrieve the remains of St. Nicholas in order to save them from the abuse of Muslims. When the relics of Saint Nicholas were brought to the city on May 22, 1087, his Duke Roger I Borsa and Archbishop Urson were in Rome for the coronation of Pope Victor III. The relics were given for safekeeping to the abbot of the Benedictine monastery Ilya. Upon his return, the archbishop tried to take possession of the relic, and popular unrest began. Ilya was able to convince Urson to abandon his intentions and the abbot was instructed to build a temple to store the relics. The site for the construction of the temple was chosen in the center of the city on the territory of the "Catapenal citadel" (a place for holding official events and ceremonies). The land was donated to the church by the Duke Roger. In 1089, the basilica was consecrated, the relics of St. Nicholas were placed in its crypt. Soon after the construction, the church became the site of major historical events: \n In 1095, Peter of Amiens delivered a sermon in it - an appeal to the First Crusade, and in 1098 a church council was held in the basilica under the chairmanship of Pope Urban II on the issue of uniting the Western and Eastern churches, which unfortunately was not crowned with success. Construction work continued until 1105. In 1156, during the capture of the city by William I the Wicked, the basilica was damaged and was rebuilt in 1160. \nThe basilica is decorated with sculptural decoration, some of which (reliefs, capitals, cornices) were borrowed from more ancient Roman buildings. Around 1130, the throne and the ciborium were created (decorated with capitals and angels), in the middle of the 12th century, the episcopal throne appeared, carved out of a single piece of marble.

{alhambra}阿罕布拉宫
{alhambra_desc}Ancient Granada lies on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada. The central place in it was occupied by a steep elongated hill with a fortress at the top. The fortress was named "Alhambra" (from Arabic "al-hamra" - "red"). The stone blocks that make up the walls and towers of the Alhambra do have a pinkish tint. But there is another, more poetic version. At night, the builders worked with torches, which left fluttering red reflections on the walls. The Alhambra consists of three parts, called in Arabic Alcazaba (fortress), Alcazar (palace) and Medina (city). The first, in the 9th century, and perhaps even earlier, was the fortress. Its main tower, de la Vela (watchtower) stood at the highest point, at the eastern end of the hill, and dominated the Alhambra and all of old Granada. As usual, residential quarters soon appeared at the foot of the fortress, and in 1238 the emirs of the Moorish dynasty Nastrites began to build a palace near the fortress. The best buildings of the palace, which made the glory of Granada and all of Spain, were erected in the XIV century by the emirs Yusuf I and Mohammed V. They also completed the wall that still surrounds the top of the Alhambra hill. The heart of the palace was made up of the Myrtle and Lion courtyards with a group of magnificent halls adjoining them, decorated in a unique "Moorish" style. After the expulsion of the Moors in 1492. Cardinal Pedro González de Mendoza installed a silver cross on the highest tower of the Alhambra. The new owners erected a Franciscan monastery with a church, barracks, and palace buildings. The largest of these is the Palace of Charles V, a monumental building with a circular Renaissance courtyard. The palace was built for over 200 years.

{roemer} "罗马之家"市政厅
{roemer_desc} Roemer is the name of the old town hall in Frankfurt am Main.
\n For over 600 years, the building with its distinctive stepped pediment has been a symbol of the city. The name of the town hall building was given by the middle of the three previously independent buildings, which is called "House of the Roman" (German: Haus zu Römer). The origin of the name of the central building remains vague, despite the fact that, on the basis of historical research, many different, often conflicting versions have been put forward. And "Römer", nevertheless, for many centuries has meant for Frankfurt am Main a complex of buildings for the town hall. The city government needed new premises, and the city authorities bought out on 11 March 1405 two representative urban dwellings in the city center, named "House of the Roman" and "House of the Golden Swan", for 800 guilders, providing the owners with a life annuity of 65 guilders per year. After the subsequent restructuring of buildings in the town hall, a large Imperial hall and a special room for the election of the emperor, decorated with frescoes depicting coats of arms and portraits of representatives of various classes, appeared. Over time, the city authorities gradually began to attach nearby buildings to the two houses that marked the beginning of the town hall complex. By the Golden Bull of Emperor Charles IV, Frankfurt was legitimized as the seat of the election of the Holy Roman Emperors. Serving for several centuries from the Middle Ages to the liquidation of the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation in 1806 as the place of the coronation of German kings and emperors, Roemer occupies a worthy place in the history of Germany. The Reichstag also often sat in the building of the Frankfurt City Hall. The town hall was also used for the needs of the Frankfurt fair. Römer suffered numerous damage during World War II and was restored after the war. Despite the modern interior decoration of the town hall, Römer is one of the most significant Gothic buildings for secular purposes.

{st_adalbert_desc} The first church on the site of the modern basilica was erected by Stephen Saint between 1001 and 1010, shortly after his coronation in Esztergom as the first Christian king of Hungary. The temple was consecrated in honor of St. Adalbert of Prague, who visited Hungary and died in 997 during a mission in Prussia. St. Adalbert's Church became the first Christian church in Hungary. Over the next two centuries, the church suffered several serious damage. At the end of the 11th century, it almost completely burned down. No sooner had the restoration work completed than the church was again ravaged by the Mongol invasion, which necessitated a new restoration. In 1270, King Bela IV was buried in the temple. The devastation of Esztergom, undertaken in 1304 by Wenceslas III, a contender for the Hungarian crown, finally destroyed the first Esztergom cathedral. In the XIV century, a new building of the Cathedral of St. Adalbert was built. The archbishops of the 14th and 15th centuries worked hard to decorate the cathedral, and an extensive library was organized at the temple. In 1543, during the Turkish invasion, Esztergom was captured, and the cathedral was almost completely destroyed.

The chapels were named after St. Andreas (later renamed St. Mary), St. Nicholas and St. Thomas.

{vordingborg_desc} Since the time of the Vikings, Vordingborg was a fortification from which sea voyages were made. The first fortified structure was a tower, from which an excellent view of the sea was opened. The castle was completed in 1175 by King Waldemar I of Denmark as a defensive fortress and base from which to raid the German coast. His half-brother built another of the same castle on the site where the future capital of Denmark, Copenhagen, arose. King Valdemar II similarly used the castle to expand into the Baltic Sea, and in 1241 it was here that he created a reformed legal system by issuing the Jutland Code. By the time of King Valdemar IV, the castle had nine towers and a defensive wall 800 meters long.

{great_printing_house_greek_desc} With the development of book printing, it became necessary to create a printing house (Druckpresse). There are numerous presses with the help of which the font is transferred to paper. Church representatives and rulers of states are interested in mass production of the printed word. \n\n
The founder of book printing in Europe is the German Johannes Gutenberg, who was born in Mainz. For some time he was in Strasbourg, where in 1440 Elia Donat's "Latin grammar" (IV century) was printed, but these were only the first steps towards creating a printing press. Returning to his hometown, in August 1450, he entered into an agreement with a wealthy city dweller, Johann Fust, to create a printing workshop. Since that time, the preparation for the publication of the first full-volume printed European edition - the 42-line Bible, which was published five years later in two volumes - was considered and began. \n\n
The opening of book printing quickly spread throughout Europe, printing houses were opened in many cities. Books published before the end of 1500 came to be called incubals. And the books published in the first half of the 16th century were called paleotypes. During this period, about 200 printing houses remained in Europe, despite the popularity of the printed book, many workshops quickly went bankrupt. Illustrations appeared in books, they were decorated with engravings. In 1516, a printing house was opened in Prague (before that there were already several in the Czech lands), founded by F. Skorina, it was there, a year later, that the first book in Cyrillic "Psalter" was printed. \n\n
Despite the rapid spread of book printing in many European countries, printing houses faced many restrictions, literature was predominantly religious in nature. So in 1515 the Pope issued a bull, according to which censorship was introduced for out-of-print editions. A special papal "Index" appeared - a list of books prohibited from distribution and reading. Many books were simply banned from printing. \n\n
The first printers also faced such a difficult task as the reproduction of musical texts that accompanied the liturgical books. However, it was not immediately possible to solve it. The first step was taken by Schaeffer, who introduced the printing of lines of musical text, the notes themselves, as in handwritten books, were inscribed by hand. In addition to innovations in printing processes, Schaeffer improved the type and composition of the alloy, using steel for the first time. He introduced new fonts based on Gothic handwriting. \n\n
With the invention of printing and the appearance of circulation, the book trade in the second half of the 15th century. separated from book publishing. Selling printed books is becoming a lucrative business that generates substantial income. Professional booksellers were called "book carriers" because books were carried in barrels and sacks to fairs. The books were sold in unbound notebooks, and the binding was made by order of the owners. In the second half of the 15th century. trade in printed books has been greatly developed in Germany. At this time, the book fairs in Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig acquired particular importance. Foreign visitors to the fairs came from Strasbourg, Basel and other cities in Germany, and the names of German booksellers were known far beyond the borders of the country - in England, France, Italy, Poland, Hungary. \n\n
Booksellers, whose property was 100-200 florins, were constantly under the threat of ruin. They ran their business on a lease basis, or worked for more wealthy merchants. This category of booksellers purchased books at fairs for the purpose of resale. \n\n
The big merchants from among the burghers had assets of 1,000 florins. One of their sources of income was commission trading. They engaged in usury, providing loans to needy scribes. The books were sold in shops with 30 to 50 titles. Large booksellers in Frankfurt, Paris, Venice had a staff of booksellers. \n\n
Booksellers were closely associated with printers and typographers. One form of collaboration was a partnership formed to publish one or more books. For the duration of the agreement, the bookseller became a partner on the terms of participation by means, or obligations to distribute the circulation. The printer usually bore the bulk of publishing costs. Accordingly, he owned a large share of the income.

{field_of_tournaments} 巨型竞技场
{field_of_tournaments_desc} The large lists had a quadrangular shape and was surrounded by a wooden barrier. Benches, boxes, tents were erected nearby for spectators who came to see the colorful show. The course of the tournament was regulated by a special code, the observance of which was monitored by the heralds, they called the names of the participants and the conditions of the tournament. \n\n
The conditions (rules) were different. In the XIII century, a knight did not have the right to participate in the tournament if he could not prove that four generations of his ancestors were free people. Over time, the tournament began to check the emblems, introduced special tournament books and tournament lists. Usually the tournament began with a duel of knights who had just been initiated into the knighthood, the so-called "jute". Such a duel was called just (from the English "joust") - a duel on spears (horse-spear collision). The knights tried to knock the enemy out of the saddle without falling themselves, or break their spear against the enemy's shield. Then the main competition was held - an imitation of a battle between two detachments (melee - fr.), Formed according to "nations" or regions. The victors took their opponents prisoner, took away weapons and horses, forced the defeated to pay a ransom. \n\n
The arena, where the tournament is to be held, was fenced off with a solid wooden fence, and on one side of it, stands were built of wood for noble spectators. Lodges were built separately for the most notable feudal lords, the organizers of the tournament and those beautiful ladies who had the honor to present the winner of the tournament with an award. \n\n
The large size of the tournament field did not allow the judges to observe all the events taking place on it. Throughout the 13th century, the tournament remained a fairly life-threatening business. Competitors often received serious injuries and could even die, since they used real military weapons in tournaments.
