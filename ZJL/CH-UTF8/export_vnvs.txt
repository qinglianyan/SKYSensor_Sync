{Hero_of_France_Avgust_desc}Philip II Augustus (1165 - 1223) - 国王France since 1180, son of King Louis VII the Young and his third wife Adele Champagne. After the death of his father, he fought against a powerful anti-royal coalition, which he overcame thanks to good relations with King Henry II of England, who supported him in the first years of his reign. Nevertheless, the French king, no later than 1183, began the traditional Capetian policy of supporting the rebellious members of the English royal house. During a meeting of the monarchs in Bonmoulin on November 18, 1188, Philip demanded that Henry give Normandy, Anjou, Touraine and Maine to his eldest son Richard.
Philip and Richard the Lionheart entered into an agreement under which they pledged to help each other in the crusade and to divide in half all the conquered lands (1190). Philip II Augustus constantly intrigued against his ally; he lost his temper, feeling completely helpless in the diplomatic field, but he did not dare to use force. As soon as Saint-Jean-d'Acre (Acre) was taken, Philip returned to France, vowing to Richard that he would not attack his domain. He did not attack them, but started secret negotiations with John Landless, who ruled England in the absence of his brother. Richard, hearing about this, hurried home, but on the way fell into the hands of his enemy Leopold of Austria.
After the death of Richard in 1199 in Shali. This opened up new opportunities for Philip. He continued to intrigue during the reign of John Landless, supporting his nephew Arthur of Breton, and then won a complete victory in the Anglo-French War of 1202-1214. In 1219 and 1222 he sent two armies on a crusade against the Albigensians. 
{Hero_of_France_Avgust_effects_desc}Philip Augustus died on July 14, 1223 at Manta and was buried at Saint-Denis.

{EngladHero_BP_desc}Nickname The Black Prince arose not earlier than the 16th century and is probably related to the color of his armor. There is another suggestion why Edward was nicknamed "Black." During his campaign in France, he gave up a whole village to the plunder of his troops and did not try to prevent the unrest. He kept a luxurious courtyard in Berkhampted, in Kennington. His father appointed him the “guardian” of the kingdom several times: it was too much for the child - for the first time it happened when he was eight years old - and nothing meant, because in reality, political power moved with the king to the mainland. In 1333, Edward received the title of Count Chester, in 1337 - the title of Duke of Cornish (this was the first ducal title created in England), and in 1343 he became the Prince of Wales. During his father's foreign trips in 1338 and 1342, the young Edward formally replaced him on the English throne. In 1345, Edward accompanied the king for the first time in a foreign campaign.

{EngladHero_Richard_desc}Richard the Lionheart was an English king (1189-1199) of the Plantagenet dynasty. Born in 1157. In 1189 he succeeded to the English throne after the death of his father, Henry II. Having become the ruler of England, Richard reconciled with his brother, John the Landless, swore allegiance to King Philip Augustus of France as a lord of the regions that belonged to Richard in Western France, freed his mother Eleanor from captivity and removed from himself all those who helped him to act against his father.
Richard the Lionheart came to the throne at a time when the conquest of the Promised Land (Palestine) prevailed in Western Christendom, which found implementation in the Crusades. While still the crown prince, he, along with the French king Philip, made a vow to go to the liberation of the Holy Sepulcher. In 1187 Europe was shocked by the news of the capture of Jerusalem by the Egyptian sultan Saladin, and Richard began to collect money for a crusader expedition. Richard appointed people who would rule England in his absence, made an alliance with the 国王Scotland and set out on a campaign.
During the crusade, the king laid siege to the city of Acre. The long siege ended with the surrender of the city. After that, an exchange of prisoners was to take place. On the fortieth day, without waiting for the return of the captive Christians, Richard killed 2,700 captive Saracens in front of the army of Sultan Salah ad-Din. The Muslims awarded the Christian king with the nickname of the Heart of Stone. Later it turned out that Richard released all ordinary people, including children and women. Leo can be extremely cruel, but they will never act mean. It was then that Richard received the famous nickname.
During his ten-year reign, Richard the Lionheart spent about six months in England. He was little interested in the internal affairs of England, more and more concerned about military campaigns. The king died as a result of a wound received on March 26, 1199 during the siege of the castle: a crossbow bolt piercing his neck caused blood poisoning.
{EngladHero_Richard_effects_desc}Richard died ten days later in the arms of his 77-year-old mother.

  In 1281, taking advantage of the feud between his elder brother Dmitry Alexandrovich and Novgorod, Andrey decided to speak out against his brother. He hastened to the Horde and for rich gifts received from Khan Mengu-Timur a label for the great reign and the Tatar army. But Prince Dmitry Pereyaslavsky did not want to give up power, made a trip to the Nogai camp and took him an oath of allegiance. Nogai, opposing the Great Khan, confirmed the powers of Dmitry and gave him a strong detachment to reinforce. In 1281, Prince Andrey raided the lands of Murom, Vladimir, Yuryev, Suzdal, Pereyaslavl, Rostov and Tver with the Tatar detachments of Khan Mengu-Timur, however, failing to defeat Dmitry Pereyaslavsky, he went to reign in Novgorod at the invitation of the Novgorodians. \n
  After 1283, Andrei reconciled with his brother Dmitry, to whom he ceded the great reign, after which they went together to Novgorod, forcing him to submit to the Prince of Vladimir (1284). But in 1285, Andrei again went to Russia with the Tatar army. Dmitry led the regiments towards, “the prince ran to the Horde”, and many of the boyars of Andrei were captured.

{vasilii_aleksandrovich_desc}Prince of Novgorod (1252-1255, 1256-1257), the eldest son of Alexander Yaroslavich Nevsky. \n
  It is mentioned for the first time in the annals under 1245, when his father Alexander recaptured Toropets from the Lithuanians, then destroyed their remains at Lake Zhiztsa, then drove his son to Vitebsk and defeated another Lithuanian detachment when he returned to Novgorod. \n
  In 1253, the Lithuanians raided the Novgorod land. Prince Vasily and the Novgorodians caught up with them near Toropets, defeated them and robbed them of them. \n
  In the Vladimir-Suzdal principality, a struggle was going on between the Yaroslavich brothers at that time. At the same time, in Novgorod itself, the “big ones” (representatives of the Novgorod oligarchy) were on the side of the Grand Duke Alexander Yaroslavich, but the “smaller ones” apparently prevailed, as the Novgorodians, having expelled Vasily, invited his uncle, Yaroslav Yaroslavich, to reign Tversky. Vasily moved to Torzhok, which at that time was part of the Novgorod land. Vasily’s father, Alexander Yaroslavich, having learned about what had happened, arrived in Novgorod and forced the Novgorodians to change Ananii’s chosen posadnik to Mikhalko Stepanich, and again call Vasily to the prince. \n
  Soon, a conflict occurs between father and son. In 1257, the news came to Novgorod that the Horde wants to take tamga and tithe from Novgorod. Ordyntsev was led by Alexander Nevsky. Basil, avoiding a clash with his father, before the Horde came, fled to Pskov. \n
  The Novgorodians escaped with gifts, and the Horde left. An angry Alexander drove his son out of Pskov and sent him “to the Bottom”, to the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality, and the same ones “who Vasily led to evil” executed. Vasily Alexandrovich died in 1271.

{Longshanks}传记 (1st part)
{Longshanks_desc}Son of King Henry III. In his youth, Edward was appointed ruler of Gascony. Then he married Eleanor of Castile. \n
  During the internecine war between Henry III and Simon de Montfort, Edward initially supported the party of foreigners, but then switched to the side of the opponents. Having made a campaign in 1263 against Levelin, a supporter of Montfort, Edward was still forced to surrender Windsor. At the Battle of Lewis, Edward voluntarily joined his surrendering father and was captured by Simon de Montfort. As a result of the defeat of Henry III in England, with the exception of the border counties of Wales, the reign of the barons was established. \n
  Being held captive by Montfort, Edward waited a convenient moment and fled from the army of barons to the border counties. Here in 1265 he connected with the enemy of Montfort. Crossing the River Severn, Edward managed to capture the bridges on it, and then go to the rear of the forces of Montfort. \n
  Edward not only threw Simon de Montfort out of the Ask River, but also thwarted the de Monfort plan, which intended to transfer his army back to England, with the sudden attack of his three galleys on Newport ships. When de Montfort's son came out with his army from East Anglia to help his father, Edward used his central position to defeat both de Montforts one by one. On August 3, 1265, the Battle of Kovshen took place, in which Simon de Montfort was killed. \n

{Longshanks2_desc}Edward I began his reign with the conquest of Wales. Using an excuse for the refusal of the ruler of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, Llewelyn, to take the oath, Edward forced him to surrender in 1277, but in 1282 Llewelyn rebelled again, and Edward I had to wage the war until complete victory. The Welsh principality soon lost its independence, and Edward I in 1284 ordered the introduction of English law, court and administration there. \n
  In 1301, Edward granted the title of Prince of Welsh to his son. New cities were founded in Wales, the English population was resettled there, and strong fortresses were built. \n
  Despite the fact that Edward I strove for peace with France, King Philip IV the Beautiful found cause for clashes, skillfully using the discord between England and Scotland, as well as his position as overlord. Soon, Philip demanded Edward I to court for an alleged insult. inflicted on him, and in recognition of his sovereignty, Edward lost Philip for 10 days Guyenne. However, upon the expiration of the term, the French king refused to return the pledge he had taken to his vassal. After much strife and concluded agreements, Edward I received Guyenne back. \n
  The second direction of the foreign policy of Edward I was a difficult, debilitating struggle with Scotland. The reason for her was the termination of the Scottish royal house after the death of Margarita, the granddaughter of King Alexander III. Edward I, owning all of Northumbria, accepted the Scots' offer to take on the role of mediator in the succession dispute, forced the Scots to recognize his suzerained rights, and in 1252 appointed John Baliol as 国王Scotland, who swore allegiance to him. The Scots, considering this an interference in their internal affairs, took up arms and entered into an alliance with Philip IV the Beautiful.

{Longshanks3_desc}In the war with Scotland, Edward I not only improved the methods of using the bow and used the interaction of cavalry attacks with archery, but also developed a new strategic method of conquest. His task was to conquer the brave and wild allied tribes that could evade the battle, retreating to the mountains, and then return to the valleys when the conquerors cease hostilities in the winter. The forces and equipment available to Edward were relatively limited, but he had the advantage that the area in which he had to operate was also of limited size. Building castles at these points, connecting them with roads, constantly making the enemy move, so that he would not be able to restore his physical and moral strength and return lost territories during the winter, Edward I gradually exhausted the enemy and crushed his will to resist . \n
  The troops under the command of Edward I took Berwick, Edinburgh, Sterling, Perk and by 1296 penetrated into mountain Scotland. After the surrender of Baliol, Scotland submitted. However, a year later a new war broke out with Scotland. \n
  In 1298, Edward I defeated troops near Falkirch under the command of the leader of the Scottish clans, William Wallace. Stirling was taken in 1304, and in 1305 Wallace was captured and subjected to barbaric execution. \n
  However, Scotland again rose under the leadership of Robert Bruce against the invaders, and Edward I had to fight it until the end of his life. All these wars inevitably required large expenditures, and Edward I was forced to seek help from the Parliament, which Edward finally entered the life of England.

In 1216 he met and soon became a confidant of Emperor Frederick II, for whom he was a mediator between him and Pope Gregory IX from 1222. However, the pope appreciated the capable knight, and Herman ensured that the Teutonic Order received the same privileges as the older orders of the Ioannites and Templars. Each stay of Herman with the pope or emperor ended with new gifts and privileges for the order. First of all, he achieved the pope’s equal status with the Teutonic Order with the mentioned orders and the inclusion of the Livonian Order in it (1237); the emperor presented the Order with Prussia. The importance of Herman's role as a mediator between the emperor and the pope is emphasized by the fact that after his death, Pope Gregory IX and Emperor Frederick II no longer found a common language.

  In 1346, the Black Prince participated in the campaign of Edward III in Normandy, where he was knighted and has since played an important role in the war with France. At the Battle of Crescy, sixteen-year-old Edward commanded the right flank of the English army and did an excellent job - the British won. The following year, Prince Edward took part in the siege of Calais, and in October 1347, he returned to England with his father. The Black Prince became one of the first knights of the Order of the Garter, founded by his father with the aim of reviving the knightly traditions in the spirit of the legends of King Arthur. He was not pushed aside. Under Crescy, the Prince of Wales commanded an army corps — enough to risk his life at fifteen, but not enough to share his father’s glory.
  Returning to France with his father, the Black Prince participated in the defense of Calais in 1349 and in a naval battle with the Castilians off the southern coast of England in 1350. In September 1355, Prince Edward became the head of the English army in Gascony and made a devastating raid on Armagnac and Languedoc, reaching Narbonne.

However, the French army caught up with the British at Poitiers, where a decisive battle took place on September 19, which predetermined the further course of the Hundred Years War.

First, he ordered the matrons to confirm Jeanne's virginity, then sent her to Poitiers, where she was to be interrogated by theologians, and also sent messengers to her homeland. After nothing was found that could cast a shadow on the girl’s reputation, Karl decided to transfer the command of the troops into her hands and appointed her commander in chief.

  Dziani was unanimously chosen by the Doge of Venice in 1205. However, before that he had to break the resistance of the campaign participants, who, between the date of the death of the previous Doge (June 1) and the time when the news reached Venice, chose a certain Marino Zen as their leader. Since such a choice had no legal basis, it was canceled and the Doge, in the end, was chosen by Pietro Dziani. After the Doge’s appointment, Dziani prudently did not immediately try to take all the territories that he had acquired during the Byzantine partition, entrusting them to vassals.
  Under the leadership of Venice were only strategic bases: Crete, Durazzo, Corfu and several ports, but Genoa and Pisa, whose communities defended Constantinople together with the Byzantines, did not like it very much. Genoa and Pisa hired pirates to attack and capture the Venetian ports. The biggest problem during the reign of Pietro Dziani was the excessive independence of the Venetian settlers in Constantinople. Their dissatisfaction with the metropolis reached the point where in 1224 they even raised the question of transferring the capital from Venice to Constantinople, but this proposal was rejected by a majority with only one vote. Over time, the short existence of the Latin and Byzantine empires showed the correctness of this decision. \n

{latekingpapal_states_biography_desc}Honorius III (Chencio Savelli, 1148-1227) - Pope (1216-1227). \n
  Chencio was born in Rome in the noble family of Savelli and was the son of Emerico. After being ordained a presbyter, he served for some time as a canon in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, where he was promoted to Archbishop. Around 1188 he was appointed to the post of chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church, while he was elevated to the rank of cardinal only in 1193. Administrative activities also included the exercise of the functions of vice chancellor of the Apostolic Chancellery in 1194-1198. In 1197, Chencio became a mentor to the future Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who was placed under guardianship of Pope Innocent III by the Queen Constance of Sicily. \n
On July 18, 1216, seventeen cardinals gathered in Perugia, where two days earlier, Pope Innocent III had passed away to elect a new pope. The troubled state of affairs in Italy, the threat of the invasion of the Mongols and the fear of another split forced the cardinals to compromise. Cardinals Ugolino from Ostia (later Pope Gregory IX) and Guido from Preneste were authorized to appoint a new Pope. Their choice fell on the chamberlain Chencio, who accepted the tiara reluctantly under the name of Honorius III. He was ordained in Perugia on July 24, and crowned in Rome on August 31. Honorius entered the Lateran Palace on September 3, 1216. The Roman people warmly received the new pope, who was famous for his exceptional kindness. \n
  Like his famous predecessor Innocent III, Honorius directed his efforts towards the achievement of two great goals: the restoration of Christian domination in the Holy Land and the spiritual reform of the Church. But, unlike Innocent III, he sought to achieve these goals through compromises, and not through force and pressure. \n
  Honorius died without having seen the implementation of his plans.

  Having become king, he began to pursue an active foreign policy. He managed to annex some North German territories, which was recognized by Emperor Frederick II.
  Pope Honorius III in 1217 blessed a crusade against the Estonians. As a result, a victory was won over the Ests at Lindanis and a large territory was captured. The duchy was founded on it and a fortification was built - Mr. Revel. \n
  However, he soon suffered setbacks. In 1223, the king and his son were abducted by the Schwerin count Heinrich who they invited to a feast. Frederick II took advantage of this, demanding the return of German territories and the payment of huge compensation. Waldemar had to agree to these conditions. After his release, he tried to recover the lost lands, but to no avail. His eldest son died on the hunt, his beloved wife, Dagmara of Bohemia, died early. \n
  In the country under Waldemar was a systematic activity. An inventory of land in Denmark was compiled, the so-called “Land Book of King Waldemar”, which contained information about the farms: their structure, size, affiliation, taxes paid from them. \n
  Under the leadership of Bishop Gunner of Viborg, a friend of Waldemar, the law of Jutland (Utah Law) was codified, which turned out to be the most modern of Danish regional laws. It is most clearly systematized, the interests of the king are consistently expressed in it, the strong influence of canon law is felt. Subsequently, Utah law was considered fundamental in Denmark, and for over 300 years remained relevant.

In the Western world, he was known as Meledin. As a result of the sixth crusade, Jerusalem ceded to Frederick II Hohenshaufen. \n
 In 1200, after the proclamation of al-Adil by the Sultan, he invited al-Kamil to join him in Egypt in the status of governor. Al-Kamil remained governor until the death of his father in 1218, when he himself became a sultan. \n
 In 1218, Ayyubid domains were divided into three parts: al-Kamil ruled Egypt, his brother al-Muazzam - Palestine and Transjordan, and a third brother, al-Ashraf Musa ibn Ahmad - Syria and Jazira. \n
 During the fifth CP, Al-Camil took command of the forces that defended Damietta from the crusaders. He made many offers of peace to the crusaders, but all of them were rejected due to the influence of the papal legate Pelagius. The Crusaders marched in the direction of Cairo, but al-Kamil opened the dams and allowed the Nile to flood, and the Crusaders finally accepted the conditions of an eight-year-old world. He conquered Damietta in September. \n
 In February 1229, al-Camille made a ten-year peace with Frederick II and returned Jerusalem and other holy places to the crusaders. Treaty 1229 is unique in the history of the Crusades. Without a major military confrontation, but only through diplomacy, Jerusalem, Bethlehem and the corridor along the sea were transferred to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In addition, all Muslim residents of the city retained their homes and property. They also elected their own city officials. The walls of Jerusalem were rebuilt, and the world lasted for 10 years.

{lateheiregypt_biography_desc}As-Salih II (1205 - 1249) - the eighth sultan from the Ayubid dynasty, who ruled Egypt from 1240. \n
 In 1234, his father sent As-Salih to rule Damascus, removing him from succession because of suspicions that al-Salih, with the help of the Kipchaks, plotted against him. His uncle, Ismail ibn-Ahmad, soon expelled him from Damascus, and al-Salih fled to Jazira, where he teamed up with the Khorezm people. In 1238, al-Kamil died, leaving al-Salih his heir in Jazir, and his other son, al-Adil II, ruler of Egypt. As-Salih received the support of the old emirs of his father in Egypt. At the beginning of 1240, when al-Salih was preparing to invade Egypt, he was informed that his brother was captured by his own soldiers. As-Salih was invited to Cairo for accession to the throne, in June 1240 he triumphantly entered Cairo. \n
 Soon, the emirs formed the Ashrafiyya faction to overthrow al-Salih, and the absence of loyal soldiers forced them to buy a large number of Kipchak slaves, which were supplied by the Mongols. Soon, the slaves formed the core of the Sultan's army and became known as the Mamelukes. \n
 In 1244, at the invitation of al-Salih, the Khorezmians passed through Syria and Palestine and entered Jerusalem, which was handed over to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, Sultan al-Camil during the sixth crusade. Later that year, al-Salih, again in alliance with the Khorezmites, defeated Ismail in Syria, who was allied with the crusaders of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, at the battle of Forbia. \n
 As-Salih fought with his uncle in Syria when he received news of the Crusader invasion in 1249. The Sultan quickly returned to Egypt and pitched in El Mansour, where he died in November after his leg was amputated in an attempt to save the Sultan from gangrene.

 A year after his accession to the throne, the MacWilliams and MacHeth clans, the implacable enemies of the Scottish crown, revolted; but loyal troops quickly crushed their rebellion. In the same year, Alexander joined the English barons in their war against John I the Landless, and led an army to England to support them; but after the death of John, when peace was made between young Henry III of England and the French Prince Louis VIII of France, the Scottish king ceased hostilities. \n
 Diplomacy consolidated the reconciliation by marriage, concluded by Alexander and Henry's sister, John of England, June 25, 1221. The claims of Henry of England to homage to allegiance from Alexander provoked a reaction in the form of claims to the northern English counties. This dispute was settled with a compromise in 1237, known as the York World, which defined the border between the two states between Solway Firth Bay and the mouth of the Tweed River. \n
 The threat of the British invasion in 1243 temporarily disrupted peaceful relations, but Alexander’s decisive actions in repelling this threat and the unwillingness of the English barons led to the conclusion of peace in Newcastle. Alexander now turned his eyes to the Western Islands, which were dependent on Norway. \n
 During a campaign on the islands of Alexander II, a fever broke out and he died in 1249.

 In 1205, after the death of Prince Galitsky Roman Mstislavich, Kotyan, together with his brother Somogur, participated in the campaign of Prince Rurik Rostislavich and Olgovich to Galich. In 1223, after the Tatar invasion of the Polovtsian land, Kotyan came to Galich to his son-in-law, Prince Mstislav Mstislavich, and asked him and all Russian princes to help him against the Mongols. \n
 In 1225, Mstislav brought Kotyan, intending to go to the Poles, who were allied with Daniil Romanovich, and in 1228 Kotyan helped the Grand Duke of Kiev Vladimir Rurikovich against Daniel. However, later the Kipyan’s Polovtsy were already helping Daniel against Hungary. \n
 In 1237 Batu Kotyan, defeated by the Mongols, fled with Hungary to 40 thousand fellow tribesmen, where King Bela IV graciously accepted his citizenship and gave them land for settlement. In exchange for granting Hungarian citizenship to Kotyan and his people, the Polovtsy, who had previously combined Eastern Christianity with the worship of the supreme Turkic deity Tengri, adopted Catholicism. One of Kotyan’s daughters was engaged to Stephen V of Hungary, son of Bela IV. \n
 However, the Hungarian aristocracy, mindful of the former volatility of Khan Kotyan, reacted to the Polovtsy with great distrust. Literally on the eve of the Mongol invasion of Hungary, conspirators killed Kotyan and his sons in Pest (unreasonably suspecting that Kotyan might cross over to Batu). After the death of the beloved ruler, most of the Kumans renounced Catholicism and became citizens of Bulgarian Tsar Koloman I. Some of the Polovtsians (including Elizabeth Kumanskaya) remained in Hungary.

{latekingturks_biography_desc}Kay-Kubad I - Seljuk ruler of the Koni Sultanate (1220-1237), in which the state reached its peak. After the invasion of Central Asia by the Karakites, the uprising of the Oguzes and the conquests of the Khorezmshah Tekesh in 1153, the Seljukid state ceased to exist. The Konya Sultanate was the last remnant of a once powerful empire. \n
 Disputing the power of his older brother Kay-Kavus I, who became the Sultan in 1211, Kay-Kubad was defeated by him by 1213 and imprisoned in a castle near Malatya. After the death of his brother, he was released by the emirs and elevated them to the throne. Already in the first years of the reign, Kay-Kubad I proved himself a visionary ruler. While the Mongols were conquering in Central Asia, he prudently fortified the cities, surrounding them with new walls and towers. For most of Anatolia, vegetables were grown for sale, and sugar factories were set up in many places, especially in Alai. \n
 Kyzyl Kule (Red Tower) in Alanya, built by order of Kay-Kubad. In the year Kei-Kubad entered the throne, a trade agreement with Venice was confirmed. The agreement allowed the Venetians to move freely around the country for a two percent duty on their trading operations. Operations with bread, gold, silver and precious stones were exempted from the税收. In turn, merchants of the sultanate could enjoy similar rights in the territories controlled by Venice. The exception was the failure to establish a fixed percentage of the trade duty. \n
Around 1222, the emir Husam ad-Din Chupan, on the orders of the Sultan, made a sea voyage from Sinop to Crimea. The pretext for the campaign was to protect the rights of the Romanian merchants who complained of oppression, and a little later the Seljuks defeated the Polovtsian army and captured Sudak controlled by them. In 1232, the sultan was able to conclude a peace treaty with Khan Ugadey and for some time to ensure security for his country.

 On August 21, 1165 in the castle of Goness, Adele gave birth to Louis VII the long-awaited heir, named Philip and nicknamed Dieudonné (given by God). The king was in no hurry with the coronation of his son, it took many years of persuasion of the church hierarchs, so that Louis decided to crown his son. \n
 The rapprochement of Philip with Henry II Plantagenet led to an aggravation of relations with Flanders. In 1184, the king moved troops to Flanders and subjugated a part of its lands. Although Henry supported Philip, the French king supported the rebellious members of the English royal house: Heinrich Young, Jeffrey and Richard. Philip and Richard the Lionheart concluded an agreement under which they pledged to help each other on the crusade and halve all the conquered lands (1190), but after the campaign they began to fight with each other for Normandy, and after the death of Richard, Philip began to fight with John Landless. \n
 The civil wars in England, the Staufen war with the Lombard League, the campaigns of the Castilians and Aragonese against the Moors untied Philippe's hands to strengthen their power and expand the borders of France. Towards the end of his life, Philip was able to almost completely liberate France from the British and annex the rebellious counties. To achieve his goals, Philip did not neglect anything: intrigue, conspiracy, bribery. Philip Augustus died July 14, 1223 in Mantes and was buried in Saint-Denis. His son Louis was by then 36 years old, nevertheless he was not crowned by his father.

{lateheirhre_biography_desc}Henry (VII) Hohenstaufen (1206 - 1242) - the eldest son of Emperor Frederick II, nominally 国王the Sicilian kingdom in 1212-1217, 国王Germany in 1220-1235, duke of Swabia in 1217-1235. On charges of treason, the emperor was deprived of his crown, arrested and died in custody. When listing German kings, it is usually mentioned under serial number VII in brackets, since in fact it was only the co-ruler and viceroy of the father. \n
  Henry was the only son of Frederick II (at that moment possessing only the hereditary Sicilian kingdom) and his first wife, Constance of Aragon. In 1212, Frederick II, with the consent of his overlord, Pope Innocent III, entered the battle with Emperor Otton IV Welfe. Since the pope wanted to prevent the possibility of unification of the imperial and Sicilian crowns, Frederick II was forced to abandon Sicily in favor of the young son of Henry. In February 1212, Henry was proclaimed 国王Sicily, his mother Constance of Aragon became the regent of the kingdom, and Frederick II went to Germany. \n
  After defeating his opponents in Germany, coronating with the German crown in Aachen and deposing Otto IV at the Fourth Lateran Council, Frederick II considered himself strong enough to violate the condition for separate management of the empire and Sicily. In 1217, the young Henry was brought by order of his father to Germany, and Frederick II, not abandoning Germany and wishing the imperial coronation, again became known as the 国王Sicily. In Germany, Henry received the titles of the Duke of Swabia and the rector of Burgundy.

{lateheirhre_biography2}传记 (2nd part)
{lateheirhre_biography2_desc}April 20-26, 1220 Frederick II convened a congress of the imperial nobility and clergy in Frankfurt am Main. Having previously taken the vow of the crusader, Frederick II demanded that those gathered ensure continuity of power in the event of his death in the East and that Henry be elected 国王Germany. Frederick II managed to achieve the election of Henry (1220) only thanks to significant concessions to the imperial clergy (Agreement with the princes of the church). Pope Honorius III refused to recognize the election of Henry to the German throne. The first serious conflict between Frederick II and the papacy was resolved in November 1220: the pope crowned Frederick II as emperor, recognized Henry as 国王Germany, and in exchange Henry was finally deprived of hereditary rights to the Sicilian kingdom. \n
  After the Frankfurt Congress, Frederick II left for Rome, and then to the Sicilian Kingdom, leaving Henry in Germany. Archbishop of Cologne Engelbert I, who crowned Henry in Aachen on May 8, 1222, was appointed regent in the years of Henry's early childhood. Engelbert's reign was marked by continuous unrest. After the death of Engelbert (1225), the actual power in the country was taken into the hands of the powerful Ludwig I, Duke of Bavaria. Both rulers did not educate the young king. As a result, Henry grew up vicious and licentious, most of the time he spent in the company of drinking buddies, mistresses, hunters and minnesingers, not doing state work. affairs. \n
  The story of Henry's marriage is indicative. Initially, Henry was engaged to Agnes Czech, but Engelbert opposed the alleged marriage, wanting to marry the king to the daughter of the English king John. As a result, at the insistence of his father, Henry married on November 29, 1225 to Margarita, daughter of the Austrian Duke Leopold VI, who was 7 years older than her husband.

{lateheirhre_biography3_desc}Having married against his will, Henry openly neglected his wife, and after the death of his father-in-law, who did not pay the agreed dowry, he began to seek a divorce. In 1228, Henry took power into his own hands, breaking with Ludwig of Bavaria, suspected of conspiring with the pope against the emperor. In the fight against the hostile nobility, Henry relied on the growing German cities, which caused dissatisfaction with Frederick II, faced with the resistance of the mountains in Lombardy. \n
  Under the double pressure of his father and nobility, Henry was forced to publish in Worms on May 1, 1231 Statutum in favorem principum. This document, along with the previously published Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis, actually put an end to centralized power in Germany. In accordance with these acts, clerical and secular princes were allowed to mint a coin, introduce customs duties at the borders of their possessions, and strengthen their castles. Imperial chivalry, which had previously been the pillar of the emperor, was subordinated to the power and court of the princes. They were significantly prejudiced by the liberties of the cities: they were deprived of the right to accept and grant rights to the subjects of the princes, the powers of the city courts were limited by the city walls, the cities that had previously been received from the princes by the Lena were returned to their former owners. Although Henry’s participation in the drafting of these two acts, which were the fundamental constitutional acts of the empire until 1806, was minimal, these acts were adopted precisely in his reign.
  After the adoption of these acts, Henry remained virtually unarmed in a brewing conflict with his father. Henry’s attempts to pursue his own policy without the consent of his father, the emperor, aroused the dissatisfaction of the latter. Henry's entourage, consisting of opponents of the emperor, heated his son against his father. The complaints of the princes to Frederick II against the well-favored cities of Henry strengthened the emperor's suspicion.

Henry returned to Germany annoyed against his father and began to prepare for a break with the emperor. In 1232, Henry renewed his alliance with the French king, in 1233-1234 he defeated the rebellious Otto II, son of Ludwig of Bavaria, and opposed the inquisitor Conrad of Marburg, thereby offending Pope Gregory IX. \n
  Frederick II, preparing for war against the Lombard cities and in need of the support of the pope, sharply reacted to the arbitrariness of his son. July 5, 1234 Frederick II subjected Henry to imperial disgrace. In response, in December 1234, Henry made an alliance with Lombard cities: the latter recognized Henry as their king and promised to help in the war against the emperor, and Henry confirmed their independence. Following this, Henry convened his supporters in Boppard and announced the deposition from the emperor. But Henry was openly supported only by two spiritual princes - the bishops of Worms and Würzburg, and the city of Worms itself remained loyal to the emperor. Left by supporters, Heinrich surrendered to his father in Bad Wimpfen on July 2, 1235. On July 4, 1235, at the congress in Worms, Frederick II deprived Henry of the German crown. \n
  After the deposition, Henry was detained in several castles of Puglia. It is believed that on February 12, 1242, while moving from Nicastro to Martirano, Henry died due to an unsuccessful fall from a horse. The date and true cause of Heinrich's death is controversial (according to other chronicles, Heinrich died only in 1248). Henry was buried with royal honors in the cathedral of Cosenza.

  Afonso II did not support the policy of expanding the territory and managed to achieve peace with Castile during his reign. Despite this, some cities, such as Alcácer do Sal in 1217, were conquered from the Moors at the initiative of the nobility. The first years of his reign were marked by internal disagreements between Afonso II and his brothers and sisters. The king managed to preserve the Portuguese borders, only having expelled and outlawed his relatives. \n
  Since military campaigns were not a priority of state policy, Afonso II had the opportunity to establish a state apparatus and centralize power in his own hands. He developed the first written code of Portuguese laws. Afonso II also sent ambassadors to European kingdoms outside the Iberian Peninsula and established trade relations with most of them. \n
  Other reforms included the issue of relations with the Pope. His grandfather, Afonso I, granted the Church exorbitant privileges to receive recognition of Portugal's independence by the Papal throne. The latter, ultimately, led to the formation of the state in the state. Afonso II made efforts to weaken the power of the clergy and redirect the huge revenues of the Catholic Church to the needs of the state. These actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between the Pope and Portugal.

Starting in 1236, Sanshu II captured several cities in the Algarve and Alentejo, strengthening Portuguese position in the region. \n
  Sanshu II was a capable commander, but proved to be less competent in administrative matters just as important for the state. While all his attention was focused on military campaigns, the ground for internal disagreements arose. The nobility was unhappy with the king's course, and a plot was being prepared. Moreover, the middle class of merchants often quarreled with the clergy, which the king left without interference. As a result, the Archbishop of Porto made a formal complaint to the Pope about the plight, and since the Pope had supreme power in the West in the 13th century, he issued a bull, ordering the Portuguese to elect a new king, declaring Sansha a heretic. \n
  In 1246, the rebellious nobility invited Afonso, the younger brother of Sanshu, who lived in France as Count of Boulogne, to the throne. Afonso immediately abandoned all of his French possessions and marched to Portugal. Sanshu was removed in 1247, and fled to Toledo, where he soon died.

{latekingbyzantium_biography_desc}Theodore I Laskaris (1174 - 1221) - 皇帝Nicene Empire in 1208-1221, from the noble Laskaris family from Constantinople, son of Manuel Laskaris and Ioana Karatsina. \n
  In 1199, Theodore married Anna, daughter of Emperor Alexei III Angel. In 1203 he received the title of despot - the highest court title of the Byzantine Empire, bestowed by the emperor on the closest people. He was one of the organizers of the defense of Constantinople (1203 - 1204). \n
  According to feature films and literature, many of modern people believe that the Middle Ages are dullness, disease and dirt, but this is not so. Constantinople was famous for its attractions: temples, squares, palaces, architecture of public and civil buildings. This sunny city delighted everyone who arrived at the port or passed by. Located on the border of East and West, Constantinople was famous for doctors, philosophers and scientists of all religions and beliefs. Unfortunately, due to the extensive trade and favorable economic situation of the Byzantine Empire, the Fourth Crusade against Constantinople began. \n
  When Constantinople fell, Theodore and his wife fled and tried to take refuge in Nicaea, but the inhabitants of the city refused to recognize his authority and let in only his wife. Theodore went to the Prussia region, and there he began to gather troops. The crusader raids soon showed that the Nicene people were in danger of not only political, but also religious enslavement. Then the Nicene people turned to Theodore, because he was related to the dynasty of Angels and had the title of despot. So Theodore in the first years of his reign used the title of despot, and the rich region of Smyrna represented for Theodore a material supply base. \n
  In the fall of 1204, the crusaders crossed to Asia Minor and captured the cities of the Greeks. Theodore with the army was besieged in the fortress of Prus and turned for help to the Seljuks, who agreed to help.

{latekingbyzantium_biography2_desc}At the same time, the Bulgarians began a war against the Latins. The Crusaders surrendered the city to Theodora in Asia Minor and left for the Balkans. \n
  In 1205, David Comnenus, 国王Trebizond, went to war against the Nicene people. The army of Laskaris attacked the Trebizondians from the rear, scattered them and chopped them down. Frightened, David became a vassal of the Latins, promising to supply Constantinople with food in exchange for military assistance. In 1206, Theodore led the army to Trebizond, but the Latins began to successfully help David and captured a number of coastal territories of the Nicene people. Then Theodore turned for help to the pirate John Stirion for raids from the sea and to the Bulgarian king Kaloyan for a campaign on Adrianople. The Latins went to a truce with Laskaris. \n
  In 1208, Theodore ravaged the lands of David Comnenus, but the Latin Emperor Henry unexpectedly nearly captured Laskaris. Unexpectedly, in 1211 the Seljuk Sultan Kei-Khosrov I with the former Byzantine Emperor Alexei III at the head of 20 thousand. Army invaded the southern regions of the Nicene Empire, besieged Antioch. Theodor Laskaris defeated the Seljuks with only 2,000 soldiers and personally beheaded the Sultan, and made peace with the new Sultan. \n
  The victory over the Turks inspired not only the Nicene people, but also the other Greeks - uprisings began. Henry d'Enault wanted reprisals against the Nicene people and began the war of 1211-1214, which ended unsuccessfully for him and peace was concluded with the Nicene people. In 1212, Theodore was widowed and wished to strengthen his position by wedding with the daughter of the Cilician king Rita, but he was deceived and slipped into the king's niece Philip. Relations with the Armenians went wrong. \n
  Theodore organized his last campaign in 1220 to Constantinople, but the wedding with the daughter of the Latin emperor put an end to a long war.

{lateheirbyzantium_biography_desc}John III of Duc Vatats (1192-1254) - Emperor of Nicaea in 1221-1254, son of Vasily Vatats, commander in the reign of Isaac II. John III was crowned on December 15, 1221. His rise to power caused internal political complications, as the brothers of the late emperor claimed the throne. They decided to go to Constantinople. John did not allow them to leave, then they fled secretly, and then with the army moved to Pimanion. In the spring of 1224, their army was defeated at the battle of Pimanion. After this, John besieged and took the Latins fortresses Pimanion, Lentiana, Harior and Berbeniac one after another. \n
 It should be remembered that after the Fourth Crusade in 1204, Crusaders took Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire began to be called Latin. The remains of the Byzantine Empire: the Nicene kingdom, part of Greece and Bulgaria continued their stubborn struggle with the Latins. In 1225, the Nicene fleet captured the islands of the Latins: Lesbos, Samos and Chios, and at the end of 1224 - Rhodes. The hostilities had to be interrupted due to a dangerous conspiracy organized by the cousins ​​of the emperor. Upon learning of the conspiracy, Vatac burned the fleet so that the Latins did not get it, and returned to investigate. The participants in the conspiracy were exposed, and the emperor set about reinforcing his own insecurity. \n
  In 1234, John III tried to agree with the Pope on the unification of churches, but to no avail. Then he unsuccessfully tried to return Constantinople, and in 1237 entered into an alliance with Frederick II Staufen to jointly return Constantinople. \n
  The danger of the invasion of the Mongols forced John to make an alliance with the Seljuks, and in 1241 he settled in the kingdom 10,000 Polovtsians Khan Kotyan who fled from Hungary. \n
  John devoted his whole life to the restoration of the Byzantine Empire. He died of a stroke and was buried in a monastery, which was later destroyed by the Turks.

{latekingmongols_biography_desc}Genghis Khan - the founder and the first great khan of the Mongol Empire, uniting disparate Mongolian and Turkic tribes; commander who organized the Mongol invasion campaigns in China, Central Asia, the Caucasus and Eastern Europe. The founder of the largest continental empire in the history of mankind. Temujin was born into a family of Yesugei-bagatura from the clan Borjigin and his wife Oelun from the clan Olkhonut. It is named after the captured Tatar leader Temujin-Uge, who was defeated by Yesugei on the eve of the birth of his son. \n
  After the death of Yesugei, who was poisoned by the Tatars, the taichyuts drove the family out of their homes, stole all the cattle. For several years the family lived in poverty, wandered in the steppes, eating roots, game and fish. Even in the summer they lived from hand to mouth, making reserves for the winter. The hardships and hardships of childhood made Temujin very strong. He managed to unite the families and scattered clans that suffered from the Tatars, from the Merkits and Taychutes; and then lead them to the enemies. In the spring of 1206, on the Kuronthai River Onon, Temujin was proclaimed the great khan over all tribes and received the title "kagan", taking the name Chingiz ("lord of the endless like the sea"). Mongolia has transformed: the warring Mongolian nomadic tribes united into a single state. \n
  The famous law is Yasa Genghis Khan. In Yasa, the main thing is articles of mutual assistance in the campaign and the prohibition of deceiving the trustee. Those who violated these regulations were executed, and the enemy of the Mongols, who remained loyal to their ruler, was spared and accepted into their army. Fidelity and courage were considered good, and cowardice and betrayal were evil. \n
  The population was divided into tens, hundreds, thousands and tumens (10tys), tribes and clans were mixed, and verified people were appointed commanders. All adult men were considered warriors in wartime. The armed forces of Genghis Khan, formed in this way, amounted to 100 thousand.

{JochiKhan_biography}传记
{JochiKhan_biography_desc}Jochi (1184-1227) is the eldest son of Genghis Khan and his first wife, Borte of the Ungirat tribe. The commander who participated in the conquest of Central Asia, commanded an independent detachment in the lower Syr Darya. \n
  Jochi was born around 1182 from the first, most respected and influential wife of Genghis Khan Borte, but who is his real father is not known for certain. The main reason for challenging the fatherhood of Genghis Khan is the capture of his wife Borte by the Merkit tribe, soon after the release of which Jochi was born. Temujin recognized Jochi as his son, but the "curse of the Merkit captivity" hung on Jochi all his life. \n
  How was childhood and youth Jochi, no information. Again in medieval narratives, his name appears when he was already twenty-five years old. According to The Secret Legend, in 1207 Genghis Khan sent Juchi at the head of troops to the lands located west of Lake Baikal to conquer the tribes living in those forests. The tribes, not joining the battle, recognized the rule of the Mongol Khan. As a result, the Jochi obeyed such forest peoples as Teleuts, Ursuts, and a number of other peoples. Under pressure from the army of Jochi, the Yenisei Kirghiz, who lived in the upper Yenisei, obeyed. Then the Kyrgyz noyons came to Juchi, bringing him white gyrfalcons, white horses and white sables. \n
  By decision of Genghis Khan, in 1213, the Mongol campaign against Jin began. The western group of forces was led by Jochi and his brothers Chagatai and Ogedei. They captured the most trophies, but killed many civilians. In 1218, Jochi defeated the rebellious Kirghiz by the Yenisei River. \n
  The last years of Jochi's life went on in a bad relationship with his father. It is believed that Jochi refused to obey his father’s order - to conquer the Kipchaks, Russians and Circassians. Genghis Khan sent an army against Jochi, but Jochi died.

{ChagataiKhan_biography}传记
{ChagataiKhan_biography_desc}Chagatai (1185-1242) is the Mongol sovereign, the second son of Genghis Khan and Borte. Even during the life of his father, he was known as the best connoisseur of Yasa and the highest authority in all matters related to laws and customs. \n
  Like the brothers, Chagatai took part in the campaigns of his father against the Jin Empire (1211-1215) and against Khorezm (1219-1224). The capital of the Khorezmshah, Gurganj, was besieged by three princes - Juchi, Chagatai and Ugadei and was taken on April 24, 1221. In the same year, the eldest son of Chagatai Mutugen was killed near Bamian. After the battle on the Indus, Chagatai was entrusted with the persecution of the Khorezmshah Jalal ad-Din, as a result of which he spent the winter in India. K After the death of his father, Chagatai no longer participated in the campaigns. As the eldest son of a deceased ruler (his brother Jochi died even earlier than his father), he enjoyed great authority. As a connoisseur and guardian of the law, he throughout the empire possessed such power, which even the great Khan Ugedei himself had to obey. \n
  Chagatay received from his father all the lands from the country of the Uigurs in the east to Bukhara and Samarkand in the west. In relation to Islam, Chagatay was unfavorable. Violations of the Mongolian law, which were prosecuted by him with inexorable残暴, included the execution of certain Islamic precepts. It was forbidden for the Mongols to slit their throats when killing animals, as prescribed by Sharia; Muslims just as often violated during their ablutions the prohibition to enter the flowing water. The残暴 with which such misconduct was punished by Chagatai made his name hated by all Muslims. \n
  Chagatay survived his brother Ogedei only for a few months. His doctors, a minister of Chinese descent and a Muslim court physician, Majd al-Din, were executed because they were unable to save the life of their sovereign.

{UgedaiKhan_biography}传记
{UgedaiKhan_biography_desc}Ogedei (1186-1241) is the third son of Genghis Khan and Borte and the successor of his father as a kagan of the Mongol Empire. Long before his death, Genghis Khan chose Ogedei as a successor, and in September 1229 this choice was approved by the kurultai; until this moment, the empire was governed as regent by his youngest son, Toluy. Ogedei carried out a series of successful administrative reforms and continued the expansionist policies of Genghis Khan. Like his other sons, he participated in campaigns in North China and Central Asia. Ogedei was known for influencing doubters in any discussion in which he participated, because of his personality. He was physically developed, intelligent, had a stable character. \n
  Although Ugedei himself after the campaign in Northern China in 1232 personally no longer led the fighting, the aggressive policy on the outskirts of the Mongol Empire did not weaken. His nephew Batu Khan and the military commander Subedey-Bagatur were sent on a campaign to the West, where they conquered and devastated Bulgaria, Russia, Poland, and Hungary. The army of Chormagan sent to the Middle East defeated the last Khorezmshah Jalal ad-Din. \n
  Ogedei carried out a number of reforms: a postal service (yam) was organized, a population census was carried out, the tax system was improved, a communications system (above-ground and underground) was developed, and the construction of the capital of the empire, Karakorum, was completed. Representatives of the local nobility were actively involved. \n
  He had a reputation as a drunkard who abused alcohol. Not a traditional Mongolian drink irak (fermented mare's milk), but wine. His retinue, for medical reasons instructing Ugadei to consume fewer cups of wine a day, appointed a special officer whose duty was to take the enchantment drunk by the khan; however, a decrease in their number meant only that Ugadei got a bigger goblet for himself. Died of wine abuse.

In 1251, his son Munke was posthumously awarded the imperial title Ying-u huan-di (“Valiant and warlike emperor”) and in 1265, the fourth son of Toluya, Khubilai, assigned him another posthumous title - Jing-xiang huang-di (“Brilliant and helped Emperor "). \n
  At the initial stage of the conquest of the state, Khorezmshah Tolui accompanied his father. After the capture of Balkh in early 1221, he was entrusted with the conquest of the rest of Khorasan. Toluy moved west to Maruchak (northwestern corner of present-day Afghanistan), then, crossing the Murghab and his left tributary Kushka (tributary of the Murghab), he turned along the river to the north, to Merv. Seven days the Mongols stormed the city. The next day, the governor Merv surrendered the city, believing promises of mercy, but the inhabitants were driven out into the open field and chopped down, leaving the artisans alive, and the children taken into slavery. From Merv, Tolui went to Nishapur. Prior to this, the townspeople defeated Togachar’s detachment and killed him, but Toluy was offered the terms of surrender. Tolui refused them and began the assault. As in Merv, the inhabitants were driven out into the open field and chopped up, and the city was destroyed. In Herat, his ambassador was executed, and Tolui went to storm the city. The governor of the Sultan died and Toluy promised the Heratians life if they surrendered. Residents obeyed, and the condition was met, the exception was 12,000 troops. After Tolui returned to Genghis Khan. \n
  According to Mongolian custom, Toluy, as the youngest son, the “keeper of the outbreak” (igigin), was to inherit his father’s personal yurt - actually Mongolia. He died in the fall of 1232 after spending his sick brother Ugedei.

{Jebe_biography_desc}Jebe Noyon (1181-1225) is a Mongol commander, temnik and, perhaps, the best commander of Genghis Khan. \n
  Jirgoadai came from the Yisut (Besut) tribe, which is attributed to the Mongols-Niruns, that is, the “Mongols proper”, but most likely he was a commoner (Utegu-Bogol). \n
  According to The Secret Legend, the story of Jebe's appearance in the service of Temujin is as follows: During the battle with the taijiuts in the Koiten tract (1201), Temujin was wounded by an arrow. Having recovered from the wound, the Mongolian khan asked the taijiut prisoners (hiding the fact of his wound): “Do you know who shot this neck vertebra to my white-faced Savrasi war horse?” To which Jirgoadai boldly replied: “I shot from the mountain!” If the khan orders me to be executed, then only a wet place will remain from me in the palm of my hand. If the khan so deigns, then I will serve him. ” Temujin liked the honesty and fearlessness of the marksman. Jirgoaday received from the Khan the nickname Jae, which in Mongolian means "arrow." \n
  After serving with Genghis Khan as a foreman, five years later he received a thousand under his command. He took part in the wars with the Keraites and Naimans. During the war with the Jurchens, the Jebe corps acted depending on the situation, then as the left wing of the army, then as the vanguard. Onslaught, excitement, the ability to make innovative decisions in a rapidly changing environment allowed Jebe, acting with relatively small forces, to win victories over a superior opponent. In 1218 he received a fog and annexed the Karakite state to the possessions of Genghis Khan. \n
  In 1219-1220 he participated in the defeat of the Khorezm state by the Mongols. After that, he went to the Kipchak steppes together with Subedai. In 1224, the Mongols Dzhebe and Subedey moved east, against the Volga Bulgars. Having not achieved success, they returned to Mongolia through the steppes of Kazakhstan.

Everything else: the use of infantry mercenaries, throwing guns, heavy cavalry, bypass maneuvers to the rear - the innovations and proposals of his commanders, whom Sudei always provided the opportunity to prove himself. He possessed a number of rare and necessary qualities for the commander: he always remained calm, listened carefully to the opinions of all military leaders and introduced their suggestions into the development and the course of the battles, was not afraid to transfer the initiative to other military leaders, the shore of his soldiers, never in a hurry. But most importantly, it is Subedai’s talent, even in the most losing situation, to leave the battle, if not a winner, then definitely not a loser. Yes, someone hurried there, someone hesitated, someone was too keen on a roundabout maneuver, but after all Subedey was equal with everyone, which means that someone who is there ... \n
  He was the son of the blacksmith Jarchiuday from the Uryanhaev tribe. He came to Temujin following the example of his older brother Jalme, who was already in the service. He participated in all the main Mongol campaigns in the first half of the 13th century. Together with Jabe, he led the Mongols in the Battle of Kalka. In 1224, the Mongols of Jabe and Subedai moved east, against the Volga Bulgars, but unsuccessfully. \n
  In 1236, the corps under the command of Subaedey made a new invasion of the Volga Bulgaria, as a result of which the latter was subjugated and incorporated into the Mongol empire. Subeday was the actual commander in the Western campaign of Batu (1236 -1242), during which, in particular, the principalities of Kievan Rus were conquered. In old age he returned to his historic small homeland. He died at the age of 73.

In 1235 he was sent to the western campaign at the head of the Ugadei army, but under the supreme command of Batu. He participated in the capture of Ryazan and, probably, the battle of Kolomna. Later Guyuk and Buri, the grandson of Chagatai, quarreled with Batu and received a reprimand from the khan. The Secret Tale describes the words of Ugadei to his son: \n
 “... They say about you that you didn’t leave the back of the people on the campaign, who only had it intact, that you tore the skin of the soldiers from the soldiers. Could it be that you and the Russians led to humility with this ferocity of yours? It is clear from everything that you imagined yourself to be the only and invincible conqueror of the Russians, since you allow yourself to rebel on your older brother ... What are you talking about, and before all, you are tearing your throat like a single arbiter who for the first time left the house, and during the conquest of the Russians and Kipchakov not only didn’t take a single Russian or Kipchak, but he didn’t even get a goat's hoof ... ”. \n

In 1247, the Hierarch met Godan and cured him of his illness. Later, Sakya Pandita received from him the administration of the Tibetan regions of U and Tsang. Arriving at Godan as a boy in the Sakya Pandita Formation, his nephew Pagba Lama, who had mastered the Mongolian language, subsequently became a Buddhist mentor at Kubilai. Pagba Lama became the Mentor of the state (go-shi) in the year of the proclamation of Khubilai as emperor (1260). \n
  In the regency of Dargan (1242-1246), Godkin found refuge in the disgrace of Chinkai and Mahmud Yalavach, senior officials of the Mongolian state. Despite the fact that the Khatun (Empress) several times demanded that they be extradited, Godan told his mother that he would only submit them to the court of the kurultai. \n
  Tibetan sources report the death of Godan in 1251, but according to Chinese in 1253, he was still alive. Upon accession, Munké (1251) executed the descendants of Ugedei, who nominated another candidate for the all-Mongol throne. But Godan’s inheritance remained with his descendants, who ruled him later, under Khubilai and Temur. Under Khubilai, his sons took part in the conquest of Dali.

{latekingmoors_biography_desc}Abu Yakub Yusuf al-Mustansir Billah, also known as Yusuf II (c. 1203 - 1224) - the fifth 哈里发of the Almohad dynasty, ruler of Morocco from 1213 until his death. \n
   Yusuf was the son of the previous 哈里发Muhammad al-Nasir and at the age of ten inherited the throne after the unexpected death of his father. He was approved as 哈里发Almohad at the general meeting of the sheikhs and took the throne name “al-Mustansir” (“one who seeks help from God”). Yusuf's mother was a concubine Christian Kamar. \n
   Yusuf II, a young and inclined to pleasure, handed over state control to the court clans, consisting of senior members of the ruling family, in particular, his father's brothers in Al-Andalus and his cousin Abu Muhammad ibn Abi Hafs in Ifrikiya. The caliph's court itself was actually ruled by the vizier Abu Saeed Osman ibn Jami and the sheikhs from the Masmud clan. With the collapse of central power and the decline of the army after defeat at the Battle of Navas de Tolosa, rebellions broke out one after another in the state. Thus, tax oppression of Almohad led to a fatal separation from the caliphate of Ifricia. \n
   Yusuf II suddenly died at the beginning of 1224 - he was accidentally butted during a game by a cow from a court menagerie. Since Yusuf did not leave any heirs, the court nobility led by ibn-Jami urgently gathered for advice and got the sheikhs to elect Yusuf's cousin Abdul-Wahid as the new caliph. But the haste and possible violations of the election process of the 哈里发outraged the brothers Muhammad al-Nasir in Al-Andalus, who elected their 哈里发- Abdallah al-Adil.

{latekingspain_biography_desc}Alfonso IX of Leon is the ruler of Leon and Galicia of the Burgundian dynasty, who ruled from 1188-1230. The son of Ferdinand II and Urraki of Portugal. He ascended the throne after the death of his father and ruled until his own death. \n
  Alfonso was the only son of King Ferdinand II and Urraca of Portugal. Having become the ruler of Leon, he took an active part in the Reconquista, having conquered almost the whole of Extremadura from the Arabs. The capture of Cáceres, Merida and Badajoz became the highest point of the long reign of Alfonso IX. \n
  One of the most important events of his reign was the convening in 1188 of the Cortes of Leon, the first European parliament. The king was forced to take this step by the difficult economic situation at the beginning of his reign and the need to increase taxes: it was necessary to raise taxes on disadvantaged classes who protested. Then Alfonso convened an assembly of nobles, clergy and representatives of cities, who demanded compensation and control over the expenses of the crown. \n
  In 1197, he married his cousin Berengaria of Castile to strengthen peace between Leon and Castile. Since the couple was closely related, an interdict was imposed on the king and the kingdom by Pope Celestine III. Subsequently, the pope changed his mind, leaving only one Alfonso excommunicated, which, however, did not greatly disturb the king, who had the support of his own clergy. \n
  In 1218, Alfonso founded the University of Salamanca, the oldest in Spain. He died on September 23, 1230.

  After the death of King Enrique I, Castile was inherited by Berengaria, the former wife of Alfonso IX, who transferred the kingdom to Fernando. At the same time, Berengaria and Fernando had to participate in military conflicts with candidates for the throne, among whom was Fernando's father - King Alfonso IX. With the support of the nobility and the higher clergy in August 1217, Fernando was recognized as 国王Castile, and after the army of Alfonso IX was defeated at Burgos, on August 26, 1218, Fernando and Alfonso concluded a peace treaty in which they agreed to join forces against the Moors. \n
  Fernando set out to conquer the possessions of Muslim rulers in Spain. Using not only war to achieve his goal, Fernando proved himself a skilled diplomat: having intervened in civil strife in the state of Almohad, he helped to seize the throne of Idris I al-Mamun. In gratitude, al-Mamun allocated the Castilians a Christian colony in Morocco. \n
  After the death of Alfonso IX, father of Fernando, in 1230 the kingdom of Leon went to the sisters of Fernando - Sanche and Dulce. However, Fernando challenged this will, referring to the laws of succession adopted in Leon, according to which preference was given to male offspring during inheritance. As a result, Fernando managed to resolve the dispute with his sisters: he allocated them significant monetary compensation, and the sisters renounced their rights to Leon. As a result, Fernando was recognized as 国王Leon and Galicia, reuniting them with Castile. An educated united kingdom was never divided again. \n
  He was canonized by Pope Clement X in 1671.

  In 1200, Yaroslav was sent by his father to rule in Pereyaslavl. In 1206, after the death of Roman Galitsky and the beginning of the struggle for power in Galich, Yaroslav went to Galich at the invitation of the Hungarian king, but before that, the representative of the Chernigov Olgovichs, Vladimir Igorevich, had managed to go there. In response, Vsevolod Chermny, who occupied Kiev, drove Yaroslav from Pereyaslavl in 1206 and put his son Mikhail there. In 1208, Yaroslav participated in a campaign against Ryazan and temporarily became viceroy of his father in the Ryazan principality, with the exception of Pronsk. \n
  In 1215, when Mstislav Udatny left for the south, Yaroslav was called to reign in Veliky Novgorod. The struggle between the princes of Vladimir and Smolensk began, which continued intermittently until 1216. During one of the reconciliations, Yaroslav married a second marriage to the daughter of Mstislav Udatny. \n
  Already being terminally ill, Vsevolod handed him Pereyaslavl-Zalessky. In the conflict that arose after the death of his father between his older brothers, Konstantin and Yuri, Yaroslav supported Yuri and was defeated with him in the Battle of Lipitsky (1216). \n
  In 1222, after a campaign of 12,000 troops led by Kes, led by the younger brother Yaroslav Svyatoslav (in alliance with the Lithuanians), nephew Yaroslav Vsevolod left Novgorod for Vladimir, and Yaroslav was invited to reign in Novgorod. \n

{latekingrussia_biography2_desc}In 1228, Yaroslav brought regiments from the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality, intending to go to Riga, but the plan was upset because the Pskovs made peace with the order and were afraid that Yaroslav was actually planning to go to Pskov, and the Novgorodians refused to go without Pskov. In 1232, Pope Gregory IX called on the knights of the Order of the Sword-Bearers to fight against the Novgorodians, who impeded the Catholicization of Finnish tribes. In 1234, Yaroslav invaded the possession of the Order near Derpt and defeated the crusaders in a battle on Omovzha. As a result, a peace treaty was signed between Novgorod and the Order, according to which the eastern and southern parts of the Derpt bishopric were transferred to Pskov. \n
  In 1236, Yaroslav, with the help of Novgorodians, established himself in Kiev, thereby halting the struggle between the Chernigov-Seversky and Smolensk princes for him and concentrating together with his elder brother Yuri Vsevolodovich Vladimirsky two key princely tables at a time when the Mongols invaded the Volga Bulgaria. In Novgorod, Yaroslav left the son of Alexander (the future Nevsky) as his representative. \n
  In the spring of 1238, after the defeat of North-Eastern Russia by the Mongol-Tatars and the death of the Grand Duke Vladimir Yuri Vsevolodovich, Yaroslav returned to the Vladimir-Suzdal land, and as the next oldest brother took the Vladimir princely table. In 1242, Yaroslav sent an army led by his son Andrei to help the Novgorodians against the Livonian knights (Battle of the Ice). \n
  In 1243, Yaroslav the first of the Russian princes was summoned to the Golden Horde to Batu. It was approved at the Vladimir and Kiev reigns and was recognized as "old by all the prince in the Russian language." Yaroslav did not go to Kiev, but chose Vladimir as his residence, thereby completing the long process of moving the nominal capital of Russia from Kiev to Vladimir, begun by Andrei Bogolyubsky.

  After the death of Rurik Rostislavich at the Chernigov reign (1212) and Vsevolod the Big Nest, Vsevolod Chermny blamed the two Seversky Igorevichs in Galich a year before (1211) for the Smolensk Rostislavichs and attempted to deprive them of their possessions in Kiev land.

{Mstislav_Udatnuj2_desc}The Vnutsi Rostislavli was sent to Novgorod and Mstislav for help, and in June 1212 the army moved to Kiev. In Smolensk, an incident occurred between the Smolensk and Novgorod soldiers, during which one Smolensk died. However, this did not prevent further joint action. First, the Allies ravaged several Chernihiv cities on the Dnieper (only Rechitsa is known by name), besieged Vyshgorod, where they captured Rostislav Yaroslavich (grandson of Vsevolod Olgovich) and his brother Yaroslav, Oleg's grandson. \n
  Upon learning of the surrender of Vyshgorod, Vsevolod Chermny himself left Kiev for Chernigov, and the Rostislavichs moved to Kiev and imprisoned Lutsk, Ingvar Yaroslavich, who reigned once in Kiev (1201-1203). Information about the reign of Ingvar before Mstislav Romanovich, who later transferred from Smolensk to Kiev, is preserved in the Resurrection Chronicle. \n
  Immediately after this, the Allies besieged Chernigov, stood under it for 12 days and made peace. Vsevolod Chermny remained to reign in Chernigov. In February 1216, when Yaroslav Vsevolodovich captured Torzhok and blocked the food supply to Novgorod, Mstislav returned to the north and led the Novgorod-Smolensk army in the Battle of Lipits on April 21, in which the strong army of the Vladimir-Suzdal princes, which also included the Murom, was defeated. and the throne of Vladimir was taken by the ally of Mstislav, the eldest Vsevolodovich Konstantin, married to the sister of Mstislav Romanovich. \n
  Mstislav occupied Galich for the first time already in 1215, when he left Novgorod, citing the presence of affairs in the south. In 1219, Mstislav entered into an alliance with Daniil Romanovich Volynsky, giving his daughter Anna for him, Daniel launched successful military operations against the Krakow prince Leszek Bely, after which Leszek leaned towards an alliance with the Hungarian king Andras II against Mstislav and Daniil.
{Mstislav_Udatnuj2_effects_desc}..

{Mstislav_Udatnuj3}传记 (3rd part)
{Mstislav_Udatnuj3_desc}In the same year, the combined Hungarian-Polish army besieged Galich. Mstislav brought the allied Olgovichs and instructed Daniil Romanovich to sit under siege in Galich. But for some reason Mstislav with the Hungarians did not enter the field battle, and allowed Daniel to leave the city. \n
  In the winter of 1220/21, Mstislav and the Polovtsy again went to Galich. The battle did not bring success. In the spring of 1221, Mstislav again approached Galich. Having defeated the Hungarian garrison near the city gates, Mstislav burst into Galich. The captive prince Koloman was sent to the city of Torchesk, which belonged to Mstislav. The Hungarian king Andras II, in order to free his son from captivity, was forced to start negotiations. After the conclusion of peace with the Hungarian king and the extradition of his daughter Andras to his daughter Maria, Mstislav finally established himself in Galich. \n
  In 1223, the Polovtsians turned to Mstislav and other Russian princes for help against the Mongols invading the Black Sea steppes. Fearing that the Polovtsians would go over to the side of the Mongols during the ongoing face-to-face confrontation, the Russian princes went to the steppe, not expecting a connection with the Vladimir army. In the battle of Kalka, Mstislav, along with the Polovtsy and Volyn regiment, crossed the river that separated the Allies from the Mongols, and joined the battle. The vanguard of the enemy ran, and the Mongols entered the battle the main forces even when the Chernigov regiment crossed only partially, and the Kiev one was still on the west bank of the river. The blow led to the flight of the Polovtsy located at the forefront and the defeat of the entire allied army. Moreover, Mstislav Udatny managed to break away from the chase, and Mstislav Kievsky, Mstislav Chernigovsky and others died. \n
  In the last years of his life, he fought with the Poles and Daniil Romanovich. In 1226 he went on to reign in Ponizye, where he died, taking the schema before death (1228).

{latekingnorway_biography_desc}Hakon IV (1204-1263) - 国王Norway, representative of the Ingling dynasty. \n
  Hakon's mother Inga announced that the boy is the son of King Hakon Sverresson, although he was born after the death of his father. The poor, poorly armed people and pagans recognized the royal origin of the child, but aristocrats, Catholic clergy and merchants were against and declared a hunt for Haakon. In 1206, a group of armed tag brokers helped Inge and Haakon flee north under the patronage of Inge Bordsson. \n
  After the death of the king, Inge Hakon was proclaimed king in 1217, which was later learned by his brother Inge - Skule Bordsson, who for a long time held power in his hands. \n
  Hakon's mother again had to prove the origin of her son: she had to pass the test of God’s court, which she stood. Bishops confirmed the right to the throne of Hakon in 1223, but the Pope gave permission for the coronation only in 1247. \n
  In 1240, Hakon received in Norway a large group of inhabitants of Russia, who fled from the Mongol yoke, and gave them land in Malangen. In 1256, Haakon captured the Danish region of Holland. In 1261, Greenland recognized the power of the Norwegian king, and a year later Iceland. \n
  Under Hakon IV, large-scale stone construction was launched, some Bible books and medieval knightly novels were translated into Norwegian. \n
  During an unsuccessful campaign against the Scots, he suddenly fell ill and died on December 16, 1263. Hakon's heir was declared his only surviving son - Magnus.

{lateheirnorway_biography_desc}Sigurd Erlingsson Ribbung (c. 1203-1226) - a contender from the party of bagler on the Norwegian royal throne (1219-1226). The eldest son of the king and the head of the Erling Steinvegg bugler party (1204-1207). \n
   Sigurd's father, Erling Steinweg (Stone Wall), declared himself the son of the Norwegian king Magnus V Erlingsson and led the party of baglers. In 1204, taking advantage of the death of King Hakon III, Erling, with the support of Danish troops, landed in Norway, became a king in the southern and western parts of the state. In 1207, Erling Steinweg died, leaving two sons, one of whom was Sigurd. After Erling's death, Jarl Philippe Simonsson (1207–1217) was elected head of the Bagler party and the 国王Norway, who became the guardian of the young children of Erling Steinweg. \n
   In 1217, after the death of Philip Simonsson, the party of baglers and birkebeiners reconciled. The bucklers were disbanded. The 国王united Norway was young Haakon IV (1217–1263), and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, Jarl Skule Bordsson. \n
   However, not all the brokers were pleased with the peace settlement. In 1219, disgruntled brokers revolted. They declared their leader and new 国王15-year-old Sigurd Ribbung, who soon subjugated eastern Norway to his power.

{lateheirnorway_biography2_desc}After several years of struggle, Sigurd Ribbung agreed to surrender to Skule Bordsson in 1222 or 1223. In 1223, Sigurd attended a meeting of the Norwegian nobility in Bergen, where the issue of who will be the 国王Norway was discussed. Sigurd Ribbung was one of the five candidates for the throne, but Haakon IV remained the legal 国王Norway. Jarl Skule Bordsson, who was also one of the candidates for the throne, was given possession by Tröndelag. \n
   Gradually, King Haakon began to take on more and more real power in the kingdom. Soon Sigurd Ribbung escaped from captivity at the Jarl Skule in Nidaros in Oslo, where he resumed the uprising in eastern Norway. In 1226, Sigurd Ribbung died in Oslo. After the death of Sigurd, the buglers elected Knut Hakonsson as their leader and new candidate for the throne. Throughout the year, the brokers continued the rebellion until they were finally defeated by the royal army. In 1227, Knut Hakonsson stopped resisting and made peace with King Haakon, marrying the daughter of Jarl Skule Bordsson.

{latekingsweden_biography_desc}Johan I Sverkersson - 国王Sweden (1216-1222), the last of the Sverker family. \n
  Johan ascended the throne after the death of Eric X in 1216. At that time he was 15 years old. He was elected king against the desire of the Pope thanks to the support of his mother's family. Under Johan, at the head of the country was first a council, led by Bishop Karl Linköping, who called himself the "Chancellor." Having reached adulthood, in 1219, Johan was crowned in Linkoping. The reign of Juhan's minors and, following his ascension to the throne, Eric Erickson, helped strengthen the state council in Sweden. Johan strengthened the influence of the clergy: expanded his powers, exempted from taxes, and joining the Danish Crusade in 1219 and capturing western Estonia, Johan began to convert the local population to Christianity. In 1219, the Swedes captured Leval and Estonia was torn into three parts: the north — the Danes, the west — the Swedes, the east and south — the swordsmen. \n
  The Swedes were perhaps the only ones who did not cause fierce hatred among the local population. At the same time, the Swedes were the first to face a popular uprising. On August 8, 1220, Johan I's army was defeated by the Estonians. The king returned to Sweden, but the Swedes moved to the Estonian coast, based on deserted islands, bays and shores. \n
  The mysterious death of Eric X in 1216 at Nes Castle on the island of Wingsingo marked the beginning of the civil wars in Sweden. Once in the same castle, King Johan I also suddenly died in 1222. \n
  Years after the death of Johan, Estonians began to ask the Swedes to return the army to Estonia, to protect themselves from sea robbers, but at that time the Swedes were no longer in Estonia.

  In 1222, Eric was elected 国王Sweden. After some time, Knut Holmgerssson Long, who came from the younger line of the family of St. Eric, opposed him. On November 28, 1229, he defeated Eric's army at the battle of Olustrum, and the king was forced to flee to Denmark. \n
  Eric again regained the crown only after Knut's death in 1234. However, the real power was in the hands of his jarls: first Ulf Fase, then Birger Magnusson. \n
  In 1237, Pope Gregory IX called on Eric to make a crusade against the pagan Tavastland. The campaign was headed by the son-in-law of the king, Jarl Birger, who, according to the Chronicles of Eric, founded the Tavastgus fortress there. In 1240, the Swedes undertook a campaign to Ladoga, but were defeated by the Novgorod prince Alexander at the mouth of the Neva. \n
  In 1247, Knut Long's son, Holmger rebelled against Eric, but was defeated near Sparrsetra in Uppland and was executed in 1248. \n
  Eric was married to the daughter of Suna Volkesson Katarina, descended from the Volkung family. \n
  The king died on February 2, 1250 and was buried in the church of the monastery of Warnham. With his death, the male line of the family of Saint Eric died out. Eric’s nickname “The Lisp” goes back to the lines of the rhymed “Chronicles of Eric”, which says “the king was not fluent in language, was lisping, and besides, chrome.”

Translated from the Abkhazian "Lasha" means "light", "bright". He was proclaimed coregent in 1207. He continued the tsarina’s policy of strengthening the feudal Georgian state. He pacified the revolts of the vassal Muslim states in the 1210s and began preparations for a crusade against Jerusalem, supporting the crusaders in 1220.

{Ranulf_Blondeville1}传记 (1st part)
{Ranulf_Blondeville1_desc}Ranulf (III) de Blondeville (1170 - October 18, 1232) - Anglo-Norman aristocrat, 4th / 6th Earl of Chester, Viscount d'Avranche and Viscount de Bayeux since 1181, Earl of Richmond and Duke of Brittany (rightfully wives) in 1189–1199, 1st Earl of Lincoln from 1217, son of Hugo de Quevilloc, 3/5 Earl of Chester, and Bertrada de Montfort. \n
  Ranulf was the only surviving son of Hugo de Quevilloc, 3/5 of the Earl of Chester. According to the Chester annals, he was born in 1170. Although this is a late source, created in 1265, however, it is quite reliable in displaying events related to the count house. In addition, this year correlates well with other recorded dates: the year of birth of Hugo de Kevilloc (1147), the year of marriage of Hugo (1169), the year of birth of his second child, Matilda (1171). Ranulf’s mother, Bertrada de Montfort (c. 1155-1227), daughter of Simon III de Montfort, although it was previously believed that she was the daughter of Simon (IV) de Montfort, the second of the sons of Simon III. It was previously believed that the nickname "de Blondeville", by which Ranulf is known, is associated with his birthplace - Ozuestri in Shropshire (Wales). However, according to the research of B. Harris published in 1171, this nickname first appeared only at the end of the XIV century in the annals of the Dyelacre Abbey, and it was associated with Osuestri only from the XVI century. Thus, the birthplace of Ranulf is unknown. Little is known about Ranulf’s young years. His nanny, Vimark, came from a local family. Around 1177-1181 it is mentioned that Alexander was his teacher. \n
  On June 30, 1181, Hugo de Cevilhock died, after which Ranulf inherited his possessions and titles. Since he was a minor, King Henry II Plantagenet personally took custody of the young heir.
{Ranulf_Blondeville1_effects_desc}..

{Ranulf_Blondeville2}传记 (2nd part)
{Ranulf_Blondeville2_desc}Ranulf was declared an adult in 1187. Such an early recognition of the independence of the young Earl of Chester was probably due to the king's ambitious plans for him. Soon, Henry II married Ranulf to the Duchess of Constance of Breton, daughter and heiress of Duke Conan IV of Breton, widow of the royal son Geoffrey (Jeffrey), who ruled the duchy on behalf of Arthur, the posthumous son from a marriage with Geoffrey. Chester annals report that Ranulf was knighted by Henry II on January 1, 1189, and married Constance on February 3, but the text is confused here, most likely both events occurred in 1188. Thus, the young count was at the forefront of the Plantagenet continental policy, aimed at confronting the French in their attempts to capture Brittany. In addition, Ranulf was transferred to the English possessions with the title of Earl of Richmond, the rights to which had Constance. It is possible that by 1190 he celebrated his new status, a second seal was made for him, which was created on the basis of the seals of the previous Dukes of Breton. In the acts, Ranulf used the titles of the Duke of Breton and the Earl of Richmond, although not always consistently. \n
  In 1189-1194, the political weight of Ranulf did not correspond to the potential importance of his position, he practically did not participate in the events in Normandy and Brittany, and, despite recent legends, did not accompany 国王England Richard I in the Third Crusade. In addition, he avoided power disputes between supporters of Richard I and his brother, Prince John. Most of the acts that Ranulf signed at this time relate to Chester, he was probably trying to consolidate power in his family estates after a long period of infancy.
{Ranulf_Blondeville2_effects_desc}..

{Ranulf_Blondeville3}传记 (3rd part)
{Ranulf_Blondeville3_desc}In 1194, Ranulf participated in the capture of Nottingham Castle for Richard I, who had recently returned from captivity, and then took part in the royal coronation, during which he carried a ceremonial sword. By September 1194, Ranulf joined the 国王England in France. Judging by the acts signed by Earl Chester at this time, he spent most of his time in Normandy. \n
  In 1198, Richard I approved the barony of Ranulf for the Bolingbroke barony in Lincolnshire, which he claimed after the death of his relative, William III de Rumar. However, it was a local success. Constance of Breton, the wife of Ranulf, from 1189 ruled the Duchy of Breton on her own. Earl of Chester had little influence on her. In 1196, he imprisoned his wife in the castle of Saint-Jacques-de-Bevron on the border of Normandy, but this caused a rebellion of the Bretons, and Arthur, stepson of Ranulf, fled to the court of King Philip II of Augustus. Richard I may have supported Ranulf by invading Brittany, but Count Chester did not succeed in trying to gain power over his wife and her possessions. \n
  Richard 11 died in 1199. His nephew, Arthur of Breton, the stepson of Ranulf, was to become his heir, but Richard’s younger brother, John Landless, seized the throne. Not seeing for himself any advantages in supporting Arthur's claims, Ranulf went over to John's side. Constance of Breton, in response to this, divorced him, having married Guy de Toart. Ranulf accepted the divorce and in 1200 married the Breton Clementia de Fougeres, widow of Alain de Vitre. This new Breton marriage pursued the same goals as the first, albeit in a more modest way: to maintain the position of Ranulf in western Normandy, where he was Viscount of Bessin and Avranches, allowing him to influence the Norman-Breton borderland.
{Ranulf_Blondeville3_effects_desc}..

{Ranulf_Blondeville4}传记 (4th part)
{Ranulf_Blondeville4_desc}The marriage to Clementia brought him a number of several possessions in England and Normandy. However, as a result of the divorce, Ranulf lost Richmond, who transferred after the death of Constance in 1201 to Guy de Tuar, and after he retreated from John Landless to Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester. \n
  In 1204, Normandy was conquered by the 国王France, Philip II Augustus. As a result, Ranulf lost all Norman possessions. Moreover, in the early years of King John, Ranulf did not receive any substantial compensation in England for his losses. A number of historians believe that the reason for this was Ranulf’s rather tense relationship with the king. Two episodes are precisely known when the king demanded that Ranulf surrender castles and lands to prove his loyalty: in 1203 in Normandy after the apostasy from John Fouger, relatives of Ranulf’s wife, and in December 12014, in England, when Ranulf was in alliance with the king Powys Gwenwinwin, with whom John was at enmity. In both cases, Count Chester managed to prove his loyalty, after which the sanctions against him were lifted. \n
  The signatures of Ranulf on various acts show that he often performed official duties under the king, especially in Normandy at the beginning of 1204. Ranulf suffered heavy losses in Normandy; although there is no evidence that he was on the verge of rebellion, the king decided not to put his loyalty to the test further: in March 1205, John Bezemmelny transferred to Earl Chester most of the Richmond possessions in Yorkshire, previously owned by the recently deceased Earl of Leicester, and also exempted him from paying a number of debts.

But John, who was forced to sign the Charter, did not want to abide by it, so the barons proclaimed King Louis, heir to the French king Philip II Augustus. However, after the death of John on October 19, 1216, his young son Henry III was proclaimed king, William Marshall, 1st Earl of Pembroke, became regent with him. On May 20, 1217, at the Battle of Lincoln, an army under the command of Marshall defeated Louis's army. At the same time, Gilbert, who fought on the side of the rebel barons, was captured by Marshal. Peace was soon concluded, after which Gilbert was released and on October 9 married Isabella, the daughter of Marshall. \n
   Gilbert's father, Richard, died on November 8, 1217, after which he inherited the fatherly possessions and titles of Earl of Hartford and Lord Claire. And soon his possessions still increased. Gilbert's mother, Amicia, came from the Fitz-Robert family. His ancestor was Robert Cayenne, the illegitimate son of King Henry I of Bocklerc, who received the title of 1st Earl of Gloucester. Robert's son, William Fitz-Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester, died in 1183. His only son died childless before his father, as a result, 3 daughters - Mabel, Amitsiya, mother of Gilbert, and Isabella could apply for the county.

{Gilbert_deKler3}传记 (3rd part)
{Gilbert_deKler3_desc}Initially, Isabella received her title (d. 1217), whom the younger brother of King Richard I, John Landless, married. After a divorce from Isabella in 1199, John, who became king, transferred the title and related possessions to Amory VI de Montfort, the son of Mabela of Gloucester, in exchange for the county of Evreux. But after the death of the childless Amory, the title of Countess of Gloucester was recognized for Amicia. And after the death of Isabella in 1217, Amicia became the undisputed countess of Gloucester. And in 1218, her son Gilbert received the title of Earl of Gloucester. \n
   In 1225, Gilbert was present at the endorsement of the Magna Carta at Westminster. And in 1227, during a quarrel between King Henry III and his brother Richard of Cornwall, Gilbert supported the latter. In 1228, Gilbert led the army on a campaign in Wales, capturing Morgan Gam. \n
   In 1230, Gilbert took part in a campaign in Brittany, but on the way back he died in Penrose. His body was taken to England and buried at Tewkesbury Abbey. \n
   Gilbert was inherited by his eldest son, Richard. The widow, Isabella, married a second time - to Richard Cornwall, brother of King Henry III.

{William_LongSword_desc}William Long Sword (William Longspe; 1176 - March 26, 1226) - 3rd Earl of Salisbury from 1196 by the right of his wife Elah, English military leader, illegitimate son of Henry II, 国王England, from Countess Ida. William was the illegitimate son of King Henry II. His mother's name was previously unknown. Thanks to a document found by William, it was determined that his mother, Countess Ida, came from the Tosni clan, and in 1181 married Roger Bigot, 2nd Earl of Norfolk. \n
   King Henry recognized his son and granted him the estate of Appleby in Lincolnshire in 1188. Eight years later, in 1196, his half-brother, King Richard I of Lionheart, married him to the heiress of the great lands, Ele, daughter of William Fitz-Patrick, 2nd Earl of Salisbury. William held the title of Earl of Salisbury by the right of his wife. \n
   During the reign of King John, William was a member of the court on a number of important matters, and also held various posts: Sheriff Wiltshire, Lieutenant Gascony, Constable Dover and the Warden of the Five Ports, and then the head of the Welsh Mark prison. He was the commander of the Welsh and Irish expeditions of the king in 1210-1212. The king awarded him the Ai estate in Suffolk. \n
   In 1213, William was put at the head of a large fleet, on which he went to Flanders, where at the battle of Damm, he captured and destroyed most of the French fleet, anchored for further invasion of England. The threat of invasion was averted, but the conflict between England and France did not end.
{William_LongSword_effects_desc}..

{William_LongSword2}传记 (2nd part)
{William_LongSword2_desc}In 1214, William was sent to aid Emperor Otton IV, an ally of England, to invade France. Salisbury commanded the right wing of the army to a crushing defeat at the Battle of Bouvin, where he was captured. \n
  By the time he returned to England, a riot among the barons was brewing. Salisbury was one of the few who remained faithful to King John. During the civil war, which took place a year after the signing of the Magna Carta, Salisbury was one of the leaders of the king’s army in the south of the country. However, after the French prince Louis landed as an ally of the rebels, William went over to his side. He probably believed that John lost. \n
  After the death of John and the departure of Louis, William, along with many other barons, took advantage of the infancy of the son of John Henry III and took important positions in the government during the minority of the king. At the same time, William fought in Gascony to protect the rest of the continental English possessions. \n
  The Salisbury ship crashed during a storm when he returned to England in 1225, and he spent several months in refuge at a monastery on the French island of Ile de Re. He died shortly after his return to England at Salisbury Castle. Chronicler Roger from Wendover claimed that Salisbury was poisoned by Hubert de Burg, 1st Earl of Kent. He was buried in the Salisbury Cathedral in Wiltshire. The tomb of Earl William was opened in 1791. In it, among other things, a well-preserved rat corpse with traces of arsenic was found inside its skull. The rat is currently on display at Salisbury Cathedral and the Museum of South Wiltshire.

  After the death of his father in 1220, Humphrey inherited his vast possessions. In the same year he was confirmed as Earl of Hereford and Lord High Constable of England. And after the death of his mother in 1236, he inherited the possessions of Mandeville in Essex, although he was approved by the Count of Essex in 1239. In 1227, Humphrey helped resolve the dispute between King Henry III and his brother, Richard of Cornwall. In 1236, Humphrey was present during the marriage of King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence. Later, he was one of the nine godfathers of their heir Edward, the future king Edward I. In 1239/1241, Humphrey was appointed Kent sheriff and constable of Dover Castle. \n

{Humphrey_deBohun2_desc}In 1256-1258, Humphrey participated in the war against Wales. And in 1259, he, among other barons, participated in the preparation of a truce between Henry III and Prince of Wales, Llewelyn up Grifid. However, next year hostilities resumed again. Peace was concluded in 1262, Humphrey again participated in negotiations with Llewilin. \n
  In the 1250s, dissatisfaction with the rule of King Henry III began to ripen among the English nobility. One of the reasons was that after his marriage to Eleanor of Provence, there were many immigrants from France surrounded by the queen. For their maintenance, the king increased government spending. The barons considered this a violation of the Magna Carta, which was reported to the king in protest in Westminster in 1253. Humphrey also participated in the drafting of the protest. In 1258, the so-called "Oxford Provisions" were created in Oxford - an attempt to limit royal power in England. Humphrey also joined the royal council. In 1260, Humphrey was appointed judge for the counties of Herefordshire, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. \n
  After the revolt of Simon de Montfort in 1263, Humphrey supported the king, despite the fact that his eldest son, Humphrey VI, supported Simon. In 1264, Humphrey the Elder participated in the Battle of Lewis, where he was captured by Simon, as was King Henry III. In 1265, Humphrey was elected one of 12 arbitrators to make peace between the king and Simon. \n
  Humphrey died on his way to Kenilworth (Warwickshire) on September 24, 1275, and was buried in the clan tomb at Lantoni Abbey. Since his eldest son died back in 1265, he was succeeded by his grandson, Humphrey (VII).

  Hubert was the son of Walter de Burgh from Burg Castle in Norfolk and his wife Alice. He was the younger brother of William de Burgh, who accompanied Prince John to Ireland in 1185, and eventually became Lord Connaught. Hubert also had two younger brothers, Jeffrey and Thomas. The first became the Archdeacon of Norwich in 1202, and then Bishop Eli, and the second was the castellian of Norwich from 1215 to 1216. \n
  Hubert was a petty official at the court of Prince John in 1197 and became his chamberlain the following year. He lost this position for a short time after the return of King Richard I the Lionheart, and after the death of the latter in 1199, with the reign of John, Hubert again became his chamberlain. In the early years of the reign of John, Hubert de Burg received a reward from King Korf in Somerset and three important castles in the Welsh Mark in 1201 - Grosmont, Schenfreet and White. He also became the sheriff of Dorset, Somerset, Herefordshire and Berkshire, castell of castles of Launceston and Wallingford. The following year, Burg was appointed by John Constable of the Dover Castle and Falez was transferred to him in Normandy.
{Hubert_deBurgh_effects_desc}..

{Hubert_deBurgh2}传记 (2nd part)
{Hubert_deBurgh2_desc}In 1202, a war broke out between John, with the support of his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine and his nephew Arthur I, Duke of Brittany, who claimed ownership of his uncle. During the war, Arthur was captured by the king and placed in custody at Falez Castle. Hubert de Burgh was appointed jailer of the prince. According to an unconfirmed version, he was ordered to blind Arthur, which he did not fulfill. \n
  He was seriously injured during a long siege by the 国王France, Philip II of Chinon Castle in Normandy in 1205, which could be the reason for Hubert's termination of participation in public affairs. This is confirmed by the temporary disappearance of references to it from historical sources. \n
  In 1213, he was appointed Senatechle of Poitiers with the aim of invading France, which ended disastrously for John the following year. In sources from 1215, Hubert is referred to as the ranger of the Five Ports, and although the management of this post in conjunction with the post of constable of the Dover Castle was not settled until the end of the Baron Wars, there was a long period between the two appointments. \n
  Hubert de Burg remained faithful to King John during the revolt of the barons at the end of his reign. The Magna Carta mentions him as one of those who advised the king to sign a deed. His signature, along with the signatures of twenty-five other supporters of the king, stands on the Magna Carta as a guarantor of its observance. The king made him the chief justice of England in June 1215. In 1216, John died; his successor was the minor Henry III.

{Hubert_deBurgh3}传记 (3rd part)
{Hubert_deBurgh3_desc}Hubert played an important role in the defense of England from the invasion of Prince Louis of France, son of Philip II. Louis was recognized as 国王England by many barons and 国王Scotland. The first target of Louis was the capture of the Dover Castle, whose defense was commanded by Hubert de Burg. The castle withstood a long siege in the summer and autumn of 1216, and Louis was forced to retire. The following summer, Louis could not hold out without reinforcements from France. Hubert assembled a small fleet that defeated large French forces at the Battle of Dover and the Battle of Sandwich, which ultimately led to the complete withdrawal of French troops from England. \n
  After the death of Count Pembroke William Marshall in 1219, Hubert actually became regent of England, which attracted many opponents to him. When Henry III came of age in 1227, Hubert de Bourgu was transferred to the management of Montgomery Castle in Powis and the title of Earl of Kent. He remained one of the most influential people at court. On April 27, 1228, he was declared Chief Justice for life. But in 1232, the conspiracies of the enemies finally succeeded, and he was removed from his post and was soon imprisoned.
{Hubert_deBurgh3_effects_desc}..

{Hubert_deBurgh4}传记 (4th part)
{Hubert_deBurgh4_desc}He escaped from the castle of Devises and joined the rebellion of Richard Marshall in 1233. In 1234, Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury brought about reconciliation. Hubert de Burg officially resigned from the Justiciary on May 28, 1234, although he did not have real power since September 1232. The decision to strip Hubert of all titles was overturned by Bishop of Winchester William Raleigh in 1234, and for the time being, the title of Earl of Kent was returned to Hubert. His possessions and titles were again confiscated in 1239, but he partially retained his position by providing several castles to the king, including three castles in Wales, which he received in 1201. \n
  The marriage of Hubert's daughter Margarita to the young Richard de Claire, [Earl of Gloucester], brought him some trouble in 1236, since the Earl was still a minor and was under the care of the king and the marriage was concluded without royal permission. Hubert, however, objected that the wedding took place without his knowledge, and promised to pay the king money. In the end, the marriage was either annulled or Margaret had already passed away by then. \n
  He died in 1243 in Banstead, Surrey, and was buried in the Church of the Black Monks in London.

{Richard_deBurgh}传记 (1st part)
{Richard_deBurgh_desc}Richard de Burgh (before 1194-1243) - 1st Baron Connaught (from 1227), Justiciary of Ireland in 1228-1232. Richard de Burg belonged to an aristocratic family of Norman descent. He was the grandson of the first of the de Bourg (Walter) sources and the nephew of Hubert de Bourg, Earl of Kent and the 国王England John Landless. Richard's father, William de Burgh, took part in John's 1185 Irish campaign and received extensive possessions in Leinster and Manster for this, and later married the daughter of Domnall, King Tomond. In this marriage, two sons were born: Richard and Hubert, who became bishop of Limerick. Subsequently, William received from John Landless formal authority over Connaught, but could not establish real control over this region. \n
  Richard de Burgh became the only heir to his father, who died in 1205/1206. King John promised to confirm his rights as a formal Lord of Connaught, but at the same time recognized the authority of the local king, Catal Krobberg, probably in order to prevent one of them from becoming too strong. In 1219, Richard tried to take advantage of the financial difficulties of the crown. He proposed to the king (it was already Henry III) for Connacht three thousand marks or one thousand pounds for half Connaught, so that the second half would go to him after the death of Katal Krobberg. But this offer was rejected. In 1225, Richard married Aegis de Lacy, having thus become related to one of the most powerful Anglo-Norman families of Ireland, and thanks to the influence of his uncle Hubert de Burg became Manes seneschal.

{Richard_deBurgh2}传记 (2nd part)
{Richard_deBurgh2_desc}Katal Krobderg died in 1224. Before his death, he appointed his son a successor: this was consistent with English customs, but contrary to the Irish, which suggested the election of a new king among the relatives of the deceased. An internecine war broke out in Connaught, in which Richard supported opponents of the new king. In this, he met opposition from the Justiciary of Ireland, William Marshall, a former friend of King Connaught. But soon the crown policy in Ireland changed: it was largely thanks to Hubert de Bourge that the decision was made to remove William Marshall and transfer Connaught as Len to Richard. Despite the discontent of other English lords of Ireland, Richard de Burgh formally became the owner of Connaught in May 1227, pledging to make an annual contribution to the treasury for this: the first five years for 300 marks, then for 500. \n
  Thanks to the ongoing internecine war, Richard was able to establish his control over Connaught. Henry III transferred under his administration part of the land in the south of Ireland, confiscated from local barons, and in 1228 appointed him Justice of Ireland. Already in 1232, Richard's position was shaken due to the disgrace of his uncle. He lost the post of Justiciary of Ireland, and an uprising broke out in his possessions. But during the rebellion of Richard Marshall, who also swept Ireland, de Burg sided with the king (1234), and this provided him with further support from Henry.

{Richard_deBurgh3_desc}In the years 1235-1236, Richard finally conquered Connacht. He handed out a significant part of it to the barons, and took himself a territory with a center in Lochray, where he built a castle. This conquest created the conditions for the peaceful development of a substantial part of Ireland, which lasted about 100 years. \n
  Richard died in February 1243 at Poitou, where he was called by the king to the war with France. Since his sons were then still children, the de Burgh possessions were ruled by Richard de Birmingham until they came of age.

{Rodger_deQuincey_desc}Roger de Quincy (1195 - April 25, 1264) - English aristocrat, 2nd Earl of Winchester, son of Seir de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester, and Margaret de Beaumont. \n
  Roger was the second son of Seir de Quincy, but his older brother died early. Roger apparently took part in the Fifth Crusade, in which his father died, and upon returning to England in 1221, took over the inheritance, which included lands in England and Scotland. \n
  The wife of the second Earl of Winchester was one of the three daughters of Lord Galloway, who had no sons. Therefore, after the death of his father-in-law (1234), Quincy received a third of his lands, the post of constable of Scotland and thus significantly strengthened his position in this kingdom. Here he repeatedly faced with the uprisings of local residents; for example, in 1247, rebels besieged him in the castle, and Quincy struggled his way through a ring with several satellites and fled to King Alexander II, who eventually crushed the rebellion. \n
  In England, Quincy supported the crown in its expansion in Wales, but at the same time was part of the baronial opposition, which tried to limit royal power.

  Walter III was born before 1190 and was the eldest of 5 sons of Walter II de Clifford from a marriage with Agnes de Kundi. In 1208, King John the Landless, who suspected Walter II of Clifford of being involved in the uprising of William de Braoz, removed him from the post of lord, instead of him, his son Walter III de Clifford actually became the lord. \n
  After 1232, he married Margarita, the illegitimate daughter of the Welsh ruler Llewelyn ap Iorvert. \n
  In 1233, Walter took part in a baronial rebellion against King Henry III. In early September, the royal army besieged Clifford Castle, after 3 days the garrison was forced to surrender. Walter himself fled to his father-in-law, Llewelyn ap Iorvet, urging him to join the uprising, but did not succeed. Then he met with the king in Shrewsbury and made peace, after which he already opposed the father-in-law with the royal army, who at that time besieged Brecon. \n
  After 20 years, Walter again rebelled against the king because of the privileges of Lord Mark. At the same time, he forced the royal courier to eat the message along with the wax seal. But the rebellion was crushed, and Walter lost many of the privileges of Lord Mark. \n
  Walter died in 1263, leaving his only daughter, Matilda, who became his heiress. Clifford Castle went to the king.

{William_deMowbray_desc}William de Mowbray (1173 - c. 1222) - English aristocrat, Baron Mowbray, the eldest son of Nigel (II) de Mowbray from a marriage to Mabel. William participated in the First Baronial War, was one of the twenty-five barons appointed as executors of the Magna Carta. \n
  William was the eldest son of Nigel de Mowbray, who owned vast estates in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire with a center in Exholm. The origin of William's mother is not exactly established. In one of the documents she was called "the daughter of Edmund, Earl of Clair", however, this graph could not be reliably identified. \n
  William was probably born around 1173. His father and grandfather went on the Third Crusade, during which they died, after which William inherited their possessions. He brought homage for the lands in 1194, with a relief payment of 100 pounds. Almost immediately after this, William was ordered to pay the same amount as a shield fee, announced in order to collect the ransom necessary for the release of King Richard I. Moreover, William himself was one of the hostages to guarantee the payment of the ransom. \n
  In 1197, William witnessed a treaty concluded in Flanders.

{William_deMowbray2_desc}After the death of Richard I, William took advantage of the confusion arising from the claims of John the Landless, the brother of the late king, to the crown to strengthen his castles. But after John ascended the throne, William, like other English barons, swore allegiance to the new king under the promises made on his behalf by Archbishop Hubert Walter, Justiciary Jeffrey Fitz-Peter and Earl William Marshall. Probably, William for his oath at the beginning of 1200 was released from the shield collection. \n
  When William de Stateville renewed the old claims of a kind on Frontebaugh, which was under the control of the Mowbray, thus ignoring the agreement concluded by his father with Roger de Mowbray, William's grandfather, Mowbray presented the king with 3,000 marks. After that, the king and the great royal council made a new compromise decision: Statevil had to accept the fees of 9 knights and rents to fully meet the demands of opponents. As a result, both sides gathered in the country house of Bishop Lincoln, where they reconciled.

{Gugo_deLusignan_desc}Hugo X Lusignan (1185 - June 15, 1249, Damietta) - seigneur de Lusignan and count de la March from 1219, count d'Angoule from 1220, seigneur de Chateau-Larche from 1223, son of Hugo IX de Lusignan , Count de la March, and Matilda (Mago) of Angouleme. \n
  Hugo X was the only son of Count Hugo IX de Lusignan and Mago of Angouleme. As a child, he was a father engaged to the daughter of Count Angouleme Emard I, Isabella. However, 国王England John the Landless kidnapped his bride and in 1200 married her. In response, the Lusignans complained about John to the 国王France, Philip II Augustus, who was overlord of the English king in his French possessions. Taking advantage of the fact that John did not want to appear before the royal court as the defendant in the case, Philip II took Aquitaine from the British. \n
  In 1217, Hugo X went on the Fifth Crusade with his father, who died in the capture of Damietta in 1219. Having become the heir to the county of Marsh, in the spring of 1220, Hugo married his ex-bride, Isabella of Angouleme, who by then had been widowed and returned to France.

{Gugo_deLusignan2}传记 (2nd part)
{Gugo_deLusignan2_desc}Supporting the subsequent years of the struggle of the French king Louis VIII against the English Plantagenets, Hugo was commander in chief of the French army in Gascony. However, in the battles where he was opposed by his stepson, the son of Isabella and John of the Landless, Richard of Cornwall, Hugo was not successful. Nevertheless, he received from Louis for his service the town of Saint-Jean-d'Angeli and part of Onis. Later, under the influence of his wife and fearing the strengthening of royal power in Aquitaine, Hugo X joins the rebels led by Pierre Moklerk. During the crusade against the Albigensians, during the siege of Avignon in July 1226, Hugo left the royal army with Moklerk. \n
  After the death of Louis VIII, Hugo, together with other dissatisfied barons, opposed the regency of Blanca of Castile. However, after the influential Count Thibault IV of Champagne joined the Blanca side, he was also forced to submit to the regency at the beginning of 1227. Hugo's eldest son was engaged to Princess Isabella, and one of his daughters was engaged to Prince Alfonso de Poitiers. For this, however, Hugo was forced to return the crown of Saint-Jean-d’Angeli and Onis. \n
  In the same 1227, Hugo X rejoined the Moklerk detachments, however, after a series of battles, he changed sides and moved to the camp of the French king - after Moklerk had close relations with the English king. Hugo participated in the capture of the royal forces of Clisson, and for this he previously returned the possessions in Onis. The engagement of his son with Princess Isabella was renewed.

{Gugo_deLusignan3}传记 (3rd part)
{Gugo_deLusignan3_desc}Since 1241, relations between Hugo Lusignan and the royal court have deteriorated again - after Alfons de Poitiers arrived in Saumur as Count of Poitou and Hugo X was to bring him homage as his overlord. In addition, Alphonse divorced his daughter Lusignan, marrying the daughter of Moklerk. In addition, the crown demanded the return of possessions in Onis from Hugo, since the wedding of his son with the royal daughter also did not take place. In response, Hugo, with the help of his wife Isabella, organized a conspiracy against King Louis IX, to which his relatives, 国王England Henry III and Count Raimund VII of Toulouse, joined. At the beginning of 1242, British troops led by Henry III landed at Sens, and the detachments of Hugo Lusignan also marched there. The French army, consisting of 4 thousand knights and 20 thousand infantry, moved towards them. At the Battle of Tellenbourg on July 21, 1242, the British were defeated, and the next day, Hugo detachments, combined with the remnants of the English army, were defeated. The 国王England fled to Gascony, and Hugo surrendered to the French king. To earn forgiveness, he had to abandon all disputed lands and give the crown 3 of his castle. In the last years of his life, Hugo remained faithful to Louis IX. He took part in the Seventh Crusade and died in the capture of Damietta, like his father 30 years ago.

{Ottonn_Meranian}传记 (1st part)
{Ottonn_Meranian_desc}Otton I of Meran (1184 - May 7, 1234) - Duke of Meran, Count of Andex and Plassenburg from 1205, Palatinate of Burgundy (under the name Otton II) in 1211-1231, Margrave of Istria in 1228-1230. In the Holy Roman Empire, there was a struggle for the imperial throne between two candidates - Philip of Swabia and Otton of Braunschweig, but after 1204 the advantage was inclined to the side of Philip. The Dukes of Meran were considered supporters of the Hohenshaufen. Under the tutelage of King Philip of Swabia was the minor niece Beatrice, the second daughter of Otton I, who died in the 1200th palatine of Burgundy. After her older sister died in 1205, she received the county of Burgundy. To control the county, Philip needed a loyal ally for whom he could marry a niece. The choice fell on Otto I Meransky. The wedding took place on June 21, 1208 in Bamberg, whose bishop was Otton’s brother Eckbert. King Philip also took part in the wedding, but during the celebration he was stabbed to death in the bishop's palace by the palatine of Bavaria, Otton VIII Wittelsbach. The reason for this was that Philip promised Otton of Bavaria the hand of his daughter, but did not keep his promise. He was involved in the murder and Margrave of Istria, Henry, brother of Otto Meransky. \n
  The ruler of the empire eventually became Otton of Braunschweig. The Reichstag in Frankfurt was held on November 11th. The killer of Philip, the Bavarian palatine Otton, who fled immediately after the murder, was sentenced to be expelled from the empire, Bishop Bamberg Ekbert and the Margrave of Istria were sentenced to deprivation of their flax. The Duke of Bavaria, Ludwig I, took an active part in the investigation into the murder of Philip.
{Ottonn_Meranian_effects_desc}..

{Ottonn_Meranian2}传记 (2nd part)
{Ottonn_Meranian2_desc}However, already in January 1209, Pope Innocent III challenged the decision of the Reichstag, starting a new investigation. Then Ludwig at the request of the patriarch of Aquileia Wolfger was forced to abandon Istria. And the Bavarian palatine Otton in the same 1209 was caught and beheaded. From there, he went to the county of Burgundy in October to assert his right of succession. \n
  In the county of Burgundy, Otton immediately came into conflict with Earl of Oson Etienne III, who wanted to marry his son Jean Beatrice and return the county to his family. This conflict lasted until 1211. Only on October 18, 1211 in Dijon, with the mediation of the Duke of Burgundy Hugo III, as well as the Archbishop of Besancon and Bishop of Langre, peace was made. \n
  From Burgundy, Otton went to Germany, where in September 1211 in Nuremberg a number of imperial princes, dissatisfied with the rule of Otto of Braunschweig, were proclaimed king by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, 国王Sicily, son of the late emperor Henry VI and cousin of his wife Otton Meransky. Frederick's choice was supported by Pope Innocent III, who excommunicated Otton of Braunschweig in 1210. No wonder Otton supported the new king. On December 5, 1212, in Frankfurt, the election of Frederick II was confirmed at the congress of imperial princes, and on December 9 in Mainz he was crowned. \n
  Otton Meransky, who became an active supporter of the new king, was present at the Hoftag in Nuremberg in late February 1213, convened by Frederick II. Frederick still had an opponent in the person of Otto IV of Braunschweig, who was supported by the 国王England.
{Ottonn_Meranian2_effects_desc}..

{Ottonn_Meranian3}传记 (3rd part)
{Ottonn_Meranian3_desc}However, on July 27, 1214, the Anglo-Welfare army of Otton of Braunschweig was defeated under Buvin by the French king Philip II Augustus. The imperial regalia fell into the hands of Philip II Augustus, who sent them to Frederick. Otton had to give in to the enemy and retired to his hereditary lands, where he died in 1219. \n
  During the reign of Frederick II, Otton Meransky regained the influence of his family, taking an active part in the affairs of the empire. In mid-August 1214, he participated in a campaign in the Lower Rhine lands. In November, he participated in the Reichstag in Basel, where mainly Burgundian affairs were dealt with. At the beginning of 1215, Otton accompanied Frederick to Alsace. In the summer of 1215, Otton attended the new coronation of Frederick in Aachen. Then Otton was first mentioned not only as the Duke of Meran, but also as the Palatine of Burgundy. Eckbert, brother of Otto, who was reinstated as Bishop of Bamberg in 1211, was also present at the coronation. In the same 1215, Otton's other brother, Henry, was forgiven and most of his possessions were returned to him, including the Istrian mark and the flax in Tyrol and Bavaria. \n
  In the summer of 1217, Otton and his brother Eckbert took part in the Fifth Crusade, organized by the 国王Hungary Andras II. The reason for their participation was the promise made at the coronation of Frederick in 1215. However, the campaign was very poorly organized and already at the beginning of 1218 Otton returned to Germany. In the spring of 1218, he took part in the campaign of Frederick II in Lorraine. One of the problems that required Otton's attention was the situation in Burgundy county.
{Ottonn_Meranian3_effects_desc}..

{Ottonn_Meranian4}传记 (4th part)
{Ottonn_Meranian4_desc}Alien in origin, language and culture, Otton practically did not take any part in the management of the Burgundy county, living mainly in his Germanic possessions. Therefore, the local nobility, first of all, Count Oson Etienne III and his son Jean I the Wise, who will inherit the county of Chalon after the death of his mother in 1227, as well as Heinrich Vienne, the son of Count Macon and Vienne Guillaume V, supported by the 国王France, the Duke of Burgundy and the Archbishop of Besancon, constantly rebelled against Otto. In order to strengthen his position, Otton needed an ally, whom he found in 1225 in the person of Count Champagne Thibault IV. \n
  On January 19, 1225, Otton entered into an agreement with Thibault Champagne, which was sealed by an engagement to Otton II, son and 继承人Otton Meransky, and Blanca Champagne, daughter of Count Thibault. The marriage was to be concluded when Otton II reached the age of 14, after which he was to receive at his complete disposal Burgundy County. Thibault pledged to help Otton Meransky. The war in the county continued until 1227. The Duke of Burgundy Hugo IV was also drawn into it. Peace was concluded in June 1227, according to him Otton finally got Burgundy County at his full disposal. However, the planned marriage between Otton II and Blanca Champagne never took place. At the beginning of his reign, Otton's main residence was in Plassenburg, but then his courtyard gradually moved to Tyrol - Innsbruck, which under Otton received city status. Otton died on May 7, 1234 in Besancon and was buried not in the tribal tomb in Dyssen, where his first wife Beatrice found repose, but in the Landheim Monastery. All his possessions were inherited by his only son Otton.

The eldest of the sons of the Duke of Bavaria and Saxony, Heinrich Leo, from his second marriage with Matilda of England, daughter of King Henry II of England and Alienora of Aquitaine. \n
  In 1182-1189, he accompanied his father in his exile to Normandy and England. When in 1189, Henry Leo arbitrarily returned to Germany, Henry, in the autumn of that year, successfully defended Braunschweig from the army of Emperor Henry VI. \n
  According to a peace treaty concluded in 1190 between Heinrich Leo and Emperor Henry VI, his two sons, Lothar and Henry, were to become hostages of the emperor. \n
  In 1191, Henry with fifty knights escorted the imperial army to Italy, where he participated in the unsuccessful siege of Naples. However, he soon fled from Italy. The reason could be rumors that Lothar, who died in October 1190, was poisoned by order of the emperor. Returning to Germany, Henry announced that Emperor Henry VI had died and offered to choose him as king, but he did not succeed. \n
  In late 1193 - early 1194, he secretly married Agnes, daughter of the Rhine Palatine Count Konrad Hohenstaufen, brother of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, cousin of Henry VI. As a result, in January 1194, Henry the Elder reconciled with the emperor, who after the death of the Palatine Conrad in 1195 transferred the Rhine Palatine to Henry.

{HeinrichV_Welf2_desc}Going to the side of Hohenstaufen, Henry the Elder accompanied the emperor. With Henry VI, he went to the Sicilian kingdom. Henry also went on a Crusade, which was about to lead Henry VI. In August 1197, he joined the main army of the crusaders and departed for Acre, where he arrived in September. However, in October, the crusaders learned about the death of Emperor Henry VI and the Crusade was canceled. Henry the Elder returned to Germany in 1198. \n
  After Otton IV of Brunswick, the younger brother of Heinrich, and Philip of Swabsky, cousin of the wife of Henry, were simultaneously elected kings of Germany in 1198, he initially supported his brother, for which Philip announced the confiscation of the Rhine Palatinate. But soon conflicts began between the brothers. After the death of his father in 1195, Heinrich controlled the few remaining Welsh possessions in Saxony. However, on May 1, 1202, under the Paderborn Treaty, he was forced to give part of the possessions to two younger brothers - Otton and Wilhelm. Heinrich left Braunschweig, Northheim, Eichsfeld, Ditmarschen and Stade. One of the main residences of Henry was Stade. But his main possession, Henry considered the Rhine Palatinate. As a result, in 1203, Henry openly went over to the side of Philip of Swabia, for which he received Goslar and was restored as a Palatine of the Rhine. He also preserved it after the death of his first wife in 1204, since their son Henry the Younger was still small. \n
  After the death of Philip in 1208, Henry recognized Otton IV as king. Trying to maintain possession, Henry fought with three archbishops, but in the end he was forced out of the region of the Moselle and the Middle Rhine.

{HeinrichV_Welf3_desc}In 1212, Henry was forced to cede the title of Palatinate to his son, but he died already in 1214. After this, King Frederick II, who became the de facto ruler of Germany after the Battle of Buvin, handed over the Rhine Palatinate to Ludwig of Bavaria. As a result, Henry was forced to accept this, having engaged one of his daughters, Agnes, with Ludwig. \n
  In 1213, the younger brother of Henry Wilhelm died. Wilhelm's only son, Otton Child, was still a minor, so his possessions were jointly managed by Otton IV and Henry. Of these, Henry gained extensive possession between the Elbe and the Weser. And in 1218, the childless Otton IV also died. However, Henry did not have any imperial lens, although he sometimes called himself the Duke of Saxony. \n
  In July 1219, Henry was able to reconcile with Frederick II, receiving substantial monetary compensation, in addition, Frederick appointed Henry as imperial vicar, thanks to which he actually received the ducal authority in his possessions. \n
  One of the questions that Henry faced was the question of inheritance. The only son died without heirs, two daughters were married, but Henry did not want the transfer of possessions to another family. The second marriage was childless. As a result, in 1223, Henry recognized his nephew Otton Child as his heir. \n
  Henry died on April 28, 1227, and was buried in the cathedral of Braunschweig.

{Otton_WelfDitya}传记 (1st part)
{Otton_WelfDitya_desc}Otton I Child (1204 - June 9, 1252) - 1st Duke of Braunschweig-Luneburg from 1235, the only son of William of Tolstoy, Duke of Luneburg, and Elena, daughter of 国王Denmark Waldemar I the Great. Otton turned out to be the only heir to all Welfare estates and became the ancestor of the Braunschweig house. \n
  At the time of his father's death, he was only 9 years old, because of which he received his nickname - Child. The ruler of the possessions Otton inherited on his behalf was the uncle - Emperor Otton IV of Braunschweig. Emperor Otton IV died in 1218, leaving no heirs. \n
  In 1214, the Palatine of the Rhine, Heinrich the Younger, the only son of Heinrich the Elder, Uncle Otton the Child, died. As a result, Otton the Child, who turned out to be the only representative of the Welshs, opened up good prospects for uniting the few remaining Welfare estates in Saxony, which were divided in 1202 between the sons of Heinrich Leo under the Treaty of Paderborn. Henry the Elder, with only daughters left, appointed Otton as his heir in 1223. After the death of Henry the Elder in 1227, Otton managed to save them despite the attempts of Emperor Frederick II to capture Braunschweig. \n
  In order to have protection from the emperor's treacherous attempts, Otton entered into an alliance with his maternal uncle, 国王Denmark Waldemar II. From him, Otton received the titles of Count Harding and Tetesbühl. On Uncle's side, Otton participated in the fight against Count Schwerin Heinrich. In 1225, Otton, together with Count Orlamunde Albrecht, went to the aid of Waldemar II, but were defeated by Heinrich Schwerinsky at the Battle of Möln. In 1226, Otton, along with King Waldemar, participated in the war in Holstein against the counts of Schaumburg and participated in the capture of Rendsburg.
{Otton_WelfDitya_effects_desc}..

{Otton_WelfDitya2}传记 (2nd part)
{Otton_WelfDitya2_desc}In 1227, Otton participated in the Battle of Bornhoeved, in which Waldemar's army was defeated and Otton was captured and imprisoned in Rostock. Emperor Frederick, learning about the capture of Otto, again tried to capture Braunschweig. The army was led by his son Henry, but the attempt was unsuccessful, as the city residents closed the gates and were ready to defend, and Henry, fearing the approach of the Danish army, retreated. In the future, Frederick II, busy with other matters, was not able to repeat the attempt. \n
  Otton taught freedom in 1228 after the death of Heinrich Schwerinsky. He got to Braunschweig in September. In gratitude for the support of the inhabitants, he granted the city various privileges. In addition, merchants were able to duty free trade with Denmark. In the same year, in Luneburg, Otton married Matilda, daughter of Margrave of Brandenburg, Albrecht II. This marriage greatly increased the influence of Otto. \n
  On August 21, 1235, at the Hoftag in Mainz, Otton reconciled with Emperor Frederick II, who recognized Otton as the Duke of Braunschweig-Luneburg, having received the status of the imperial prince lost by his grandfather, Heinrich Leo. However, in 1236 he was forced to make peace with the Archbishop of Bremen, giving him the county of Stade. In return, he received a number of lens in the Mainz archbishopric, which his grandfather had owned at one time. Later, Otton was able to significantly increase his possessions. So in 1241 he received the city of Hanover from the counts of Lauenrode. \n
  After the death of Frederick II, Otton supported the anti-king Heinrich Raspe, and after his death, William II of Holland, for whom he married one of his daughters. This allowed him to further increase ownership. Towards the end of his life, he was able to relate initially disparate possessions. Otton unexpectedly died on June 9, 1252.

{HeinrichI_Smelyj}传记 (1st part)
{HeinrichI_Smelyj_desc}Henry I the Bold (1165-1235) - Earl of Brussels (1179), the first Duke of Brabant (from 1183) and the Duke of Lower Lorraine (formally, from 1190). Count of Louvain, Margrave of Antwerp. Member of the Third Crusade. Throughout most of the reign, he pursued a policy of balancing between the rival monarchical dynasties of the Holy Roman Empire: the Welsh and Hohenstaufen. Repeated participant in military conflicts, including the battles of Steppe and Bouvin. \n
  The father of Heinrich Gottfried III early began to attract his son to politics: already in 1179, Henry became known as a knight, but not yet a count. In the same year he married Matilda of Boulogne, niece of Philip of Alsace, daughter of his brother Mathieu, Earl of Boulogne and Mary, daughter of the English king Stephen. According to the prenuptial agreement, Henry actually refused to control most of Brabant in favor of Philip of Alsace. Between 1182 and 1184, Henry participated in the defense of Jerusalem, for which the emperor elevated Brabant to the status of duchy and made Henry the first duke of Brabant. \n
  In 1189, Henry began military operations against his own uncle, the Duke of Limburg. The cause of the conflict was the sale to Count Loon of trusteeship over Sint-Truiden, previously part of the dowry of the mother of Heinrich Margarita of Limburg. At the head of the army of 700 horsemen and 60 thousand foot soldiers, Henry invaded Loon and besieged Sint-Truiden. In response to the request of Count Lawon, Count Enot sent troops to Brabant and Henry had to urgently lift the siege. Nevertheless, from the point of view of Heinrich’s political campaign, he was very successful: according to the peace treaty concluded by the Earl of Flanders, Earl of Lawon pledged to pay 800 marks in silver and, until this amount was paid in full, recognize the joint ownership of Sint-Truiden with Henry.
{HeinrichI_Smelyj_effects_desc}..

{HeinrichI_Smelyj2}传记 (2nd part)
{HeinrichI_Smelyj2_desc}By 1191, Henry also made peace with the Duke of Limburg, by which allods in Arlon and Herzogenrath departed to Brabant. The year 1194 was marked by a series of clashes with the Earl of Flanders, the beginning of which dates back to 1182, and ended with a peace agreement in the same year 1194. The guarantors of the agreement were the nobility and the cities: Antwerp, Brussels, Gembloux, Jodon, Zoutleu, Leuven, Lear, Nivelles and Tinen. This agreement allowed Henry to begin preparations for participating in the crusade led by Henry VI, to which he joined in 1197. The emperor never arrived in the Holy Land, having died of a fever on September 28, 1197. The Duke of Brabant arrived in the Holy Land on September 22, and already in October of that year he participated in the capture of Sidon and Beirut and, together with the Archbishop of Mainz, Konrad Wittelsbach, besieged the strategically important fortress of Toron (modern Tibnin). Although the siege was successful and Thoron was ready to capitulate, the siege was lifted: the army reached rumors of the death of the emperor and, given that Henry VI's only son was three years old and anticipating the struggle for the imperial throne, Konrad Wittelsbach and his barons rushed to Germany . \n
  In his policy, Henry sought to expand the possessions between Scheldt and the Rhine and to control the trade route from Bruges to Cologne, which is noticeable in the significant number of settlements that received city status under Henry. Among others, a similar status was given to Hertogenbosch (until 1196), Landen (about 1210), and Jodoni (1211). This led Henry to regular confrontations with his overlord: for example, after the death of Henry VI, he, along with his wife Matilda, supported Welfare candidate Otton of Braunschweig.
{HeinrichI_Smelyj2_effects_desc}..

{HeinrichI_Smelyj3}传记 (3rd part)
{HeinrichI_Smelyj3_desc}Moreover, in 1202 he managed to win over his adversary, Count Geldern, to the side of the Welsh. However, after the victory of Philip-Augustus over John Bezemmelny and after the victory of Germany's candidate Hohenstaufen Philipp Schwabsky over Otton Braunschweig, who was supported by England, Henry changed his political predilections and became close to the French king and Hohenstaufen. \n
  In 1204, the grateful Philip of Swabsky recognized the inheritance of the ducal title, including on the female side, and also transferred it to Heinrich Nivelle, Nimwegen and Maastricht. Due to this, Maastricht, which had previously belonged to the Liege bishopric, became a condominium, that is, the co-ownership of the Bishop of Liege and the Duke of Brabant. The motto of the city was: "One master - no master, two gentlemen - master." The oath of allegiance to Philip Augustus the following year meant an annual annuity of 200 marks in silver. \n
  The assassination of Philip of Swabia in 1208 meant for Henry the next change of camp: he again supported Otton IV. The excommunication of Otto IV from the church in 1210 was the occasion for the resumption of war with the Liege bishop, who, obeying the decision of the pope, departed from the emperor. Henry got to be instructed to bring the bishop to obedience. Another reason for military action was the death of Henry's distant relative, Count Moa (1212), who did not leave the male heirs and refused his possession to the bishopric. The conflict between the duke and the bishopric of Liege was caused by the geographical position of the latter: in the middle between Brabant and the Rhine, from where wealth flowed into Brabant. May 3, 1212 Henry captured Liège and gave it to plunder. Thus, he managed to take control of the passage through the Meuse and gain control of the trade route from Germany to the Netherlands.
{HeinrichI_Smelyj3_effects_desc}..

{HeinrichI_Smelyj4}传记 (4th part)
{HeinrichI_Smelyj4_desc}In April 1213, Henry married Mary of France (circa 1198-1224), daughter of the 国王France, Philip II Augustus and Agnes Meran, and thereby switched to the side of the French king. In October, Henry continued fighting against the Liege bishopric, but this time the campaign was less successful: on October 13, 1213, he suffered a crushing defeat at the battle of Steppe from the detachments of the Liege city militia, reinforced by units that arrived from the county of Loon. The Battle of Steppe was the first battle in the history of the Netherlands in which the city police units successfully opposed the feudal army. The impression made by this victory on his contemporaries is noticeable in the “Conversations on Miracles” by Caesar Geisterbach: he writes about the greatest lists of demons who captured large booty on the battlefield. As a result of the defeat at Steppe, the Liege troops entered the territory of Brabant and Henry had to kneel down to ask the Liege bishop to remove him from excommunication (February 28, 1214). Henry's reaction to such public humiliation was the return to the camp of Welfings, marked by the marriage of the daughter of Henry Henry and Otto IV on May 19, 1214. That is why on July 27 of the same year, under Buvin, Henry fought against the French king Philip II Augustus. The historians of Philip Augustus report that Henry betrayed his allies. The victory of Philip Augustus at Buvin and the defeat of the Welsh meant for Henry the end of the policy of balancing between the Welsh and Hohenstaufen. Henry joined the winners, took the oath to Frederick II (August 1218) and received from him recognition of his rights to Maastricht.

{HeinrichIIde_Brabant}传记
{HeinrichIIde_Brabant_desc}Henry II the Magnanimous (1207 - 1248) - Duke of Brabant since 1235. The son of Henry I and Matilda of Boulogne. Henry's court spoke mainly in French. \n
  He continued the policy begun by his father to expand the duchy to the east, which led to conflicts with the Bishopric of Liege, on the one hand, and to an alliance with Emperor Frederick II, on the other. Thanks to the alliance of Henry with the emperor, the county of Dahl became part of the duchy. The war between the bishop of Liege and the Limburg house, in which Henry was involved, ended only in 1243. \n
  Heinrich also influenced Geldern and Holland during the reign of minors Otto II, Count Geldern, son of the sister of Heinrich Margarita, and William II, Count of Holland, son of the sister of Heinrich Matilda. In 1247, Henry refused in favor of the latter from the German crown. After the death of the first wife of Mary, daughter of Philip of Swabia, he married in 1240 Sofia, daughter of the Landgrave of Thuringia, Louis IV. In the same year, a conflict broke out with the Cologne bishop over Dahlem. In 1247, the uncle of Sofia of Thuringia, the anti-king Heinrich Raspe, died. The war for the Thuringian legacy began, as a result of which the son of Heinrich and Sophia Heinrich Child became the Landgrave of Hesse, establishing the Hessian line of the Brabant House. \n
  On January 12, 1248, a few days after his death, Henry II was the first in the history of Brabant to publish a charter (Dutch: landsprivilegie) guaranteeing the inviolability of certain rights of citizens. Including Henry refused the right to “dead hands”, inalienable right of ownership. Henry was buried with Sofia of Hesse in the choir of the Church of the Cistercian Abbey in Ville-la-Ville. Starting from 1236, Henry made significant gifts to this abbey in the form of agricultural land and forest.

{VillemIde_Holand}传记
{VillemIde_Holand_desc}Willem I (1167 - 1222) - Earl of Holland from 1203. The youngest son of Floris III and Ada Huntingdon. Willem grew up in Scotland. In 1189–1190, together with his father, he participated in the Third Crusade, during which Floris III died (in 1190, in Antioch). Returning home, he rebelled against his brother Dirk VII. In 1195 he was defeated, after which he reconciled with his brother and became Signor of Friesland, which was considered part of the county of Holland. \n
  In 1203, the daughter of Dirk VII Ada inherited Holland. Willem began to challenge the rights of his niece. The civil war began, which lasted several years, in which Ada and her husband Louis II were supported by the bishops of Liege and Utrecht and the count of Flanders. On the side of Willem were the Duke of Brabant and the majority of the population of Holland. In 1206, under an agreement in Bruges, he recognized the counts for Ada and Louis, and agreed that he would leave Zealand and the lands around Gertreidenberg, but in fact he continued to rule the entire county. Since Willem was a supporter of the Welsh, Emperor Otton IV in 1208 recognized him as Count of Holland. However, after the Battle of Buvin in 1214, Willem switched to the side of Frederick II. \n
  He participated in the French expedition against the English king John of the Landless, the crusade against the Prussians, in the conquest of Alcácer. In Europe he was called Willem Crazy for his desperate behavior in battles. During the Fifth Crusade, Willem conquered the city of Damietta. During the reign of Willem I in the Netherlands, irrigation work began on the drainage of swamps, the construction of dams. \n
  Willem I granted city rights to Gertreidenberg (1213), Dordrecht (1217), Middelburg (1220) and, possibly, Leiden. This contributed to the development of trade.

{HeinrichI_Borvin}传记 (1st part)
{HeinrichI_Borvin_desc}Heinrich Borwin I (1150 - 1227) - Prince of Mecklenburg from 1178, son of Prince Pribislav and Pomeranian Princess Wojislav. \n
  On December 30, 1178, Heinrich Borvin's father, Prince Pribislav, died in Luneburg from a wound received at a knightly tournament. Shortly before this, his only son and heir, Heinrich Borwin, married Matilda, the illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, Heinrich Leo. This marriage sealed the union between Pribislav, the father of Heinrich Borvin, and his overlord Heinrich Leo. The first years of the reign of Heinrich Borvin passed in the war with a cousin Nikolai (Niklot) for the Mecklenburg inheritance. Since Heinrich Borvin's father-in-law, Heinrich Leo, was deprived of most of the possessions by Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1180, Heinrich Borwin was without support. \n
  The war was with varying success. Initially, the advantage was on the side of Heinrich Borvin, who was able to capture Mecklenburg and Rostock, and Niklot fled to the new Duke of Saxony Bernhard III, and then to Margrave Brandenburg Otton I, Bernhard’s brother. Later, Prince Rugen Jaromar, who took the side of Niklot, and the Pomeranian prince Bohuslav I, who supported his nephew Heinrich Borvin, intervened in the feud. Later, Henry Borwin was captured by Jaromar Ryugensky, who sent him to the 国王Denmark Knud VI, and Niklot was captured by Bohuslav Pomeranian. The 国王Denmark took advantage of the capture of the Mecklenburg princes and, thanks to this, was able to seriously strengthen his position on the coast of the Baltic Sea, as Heinrich Borwin and Niklot gained freedom only after they recognized themselves as vassals of the 国王Denmark in 1185. As a result, Mecklenburg and Ilovo were recognized by King Knud as the possession of Heinrich Borvin, and Niklot was given control of Rostock.
{HeinrichI_Borvin_effects_desc}..

{HeinrichI_Borvin2}传记 (2nd part)
{HeinrichI_Borvin2_desc}In 1200, Heinrich Borwin and Nikloth, on the orders of King Knut, made a trip to Ratzeburg, owned by Count Adolf von Dassel. On May 25, they met in the battle near Vashov with the army of Count Adolf. As a result, Niklot was killed, but the battle itself ended with the victory of the Mecklenburgers, and Adolf himself was able to escape with difficulty. Since Niklot did not leave children, Henry Borwin inherited his possessions. \n
  In December 1201, Heinrich Borwin participated in the campaign of King Knud's army against Count Adolph III von Schauenburg. After the death of King Knud, Henry Borwin supported his heir, King Waldemar II. Thanks to this, Heinrich Borwin was able to increase his possessions - in 1203 the king transferred him to flax Gadebusch and Ratzeburg. \n
  In 1218/1219, Heinrich Borwin took part in the seizure of Estland by the Danes, and in 1225-1227 in the struggle against the counts of Holstein. During the reign of Heinrich Borvin, Rostock and Wismar received city status. Heinrich Borwin also contributed to the establishment of the monasteries of Dobbertin, Tempzin and Neukloster. \n
  Heinrich Borwin died on January 28, 1227 and was buried in the Doberan Monastery. During his lifetime, two sons, Heinrich Borwin II, Nikolai (Niklot) II, received part of his father's possessions in management. Since both of them died before their father, Mecklenburg inherited the four sons of Heinrich Borwin II, who in 1234 divided the possessions among themselves.

  After the death of his father (1190), he inherited with his brother Frederick (d. 1217). Another brother, Heinrich, in 1212 received the possession of Hachberg. In 1217, Herman V and Frederick took part in the crusade. At the battle of Damietta, Friedrich died, and Herman became the sole ruler of Baden. In 1219, Herman V married Irmengard of the Rhine, receiving Pforzheim as a dowry, and Ettlingen as a flax. In 1227, after the death of his father-in-law - Henry I of Rhine, he inherited Braunschweig together with his brother-in-law Otton of Bavaria. The right to purchase Lauffen, Sinsheim and Eppingen exchanged his share with the emperor in Durlah. \n
  In 1226, after the death of her niece, Gertrude von Dagsburg, Herman and his brother Heinrich inherited her possessions. Since there were other applicants for them (Counts Leiningen), the brothers sold these lands to the Bishop of Strasbourg, Bertold von Theck. Hermann bought the aforementioned lords of Lauffen, Sinsheim and Eppingen for his share of this transaction. \n
  In political activity, Herman V supported King Philip (1198-1208), then until 1212 - Otto of Braunschweig, from 1212 - Frederick II, whom he accompanied in many campaigns. Herman V was the patron saint of the monasteries of Maulbronn, Tennenbach, Herrenalb, Seltz, Zalem, and Backnang. His wife, Irmengard, founded the Lichtental Monastery in modern Baden-Baden, which became the tomb for members of the Margrave family. In 1219, German V granted the city rights to Stuttgart, which at that time was part of his domain. Also with him, the cities of Backnang and Besigheim were founded.

{LudwigI_Kelheim}传记 (1st part)
{LudwigI_Kelheim_desc}Ludwig I of Kelheim (1173 - 1231) - Duke of Bavaria from 1183 from the Wittelsbach dynasty, the youngest son of Duke Otto I and Agnes van Looz. Ludwig was born on December 23, 1173 in Kelheim. And on July 11, 1183, his father, the Duke of Bavaria, Otton I, died. Since the older brothers of Ludwig had already died by then, Bavaria inherited Ludwig, who was not yet 10 years old. Three youngest brothers of the father became the regents at the young duke - Archbishop of Mainz Konrad, Bavaria Otto VI (VII) Palatine (died 1189) and Frederick II, Woert Palatine and Count Längenfeld, as well as his mother, Agnes van Looz (deceased in 1191) . \n
   Ludwig's position in Bavaria, in which there were many supporters of Heinrich Leo, deprived of the duchy in 1180, was not very strong at first. In 1192 there was an uprising of the Bavarian nobility, but thanks to the support of Emperor Henry VI, Ludwig retained his possessions. On May 24, 1192 in Worms, Ludwig was recognized by Henry VI as an adult and entered into independent control of the duchy. \n
   Until the death of Henry VI, Ludwig remained his loyal supporter. In 1194, he accompanied the emperor on an Italian campaign to conquer the Sicilian kingdom. And after the unexpected death of Henry VI, Ludwig remained a supporter of the Hohenstaufen, becoming one of the leaders of the party, which ensured the election of Philip of Swabsky, brother of Henry VI, as king. In the future, Ludwig invariably kept Philip's side in the struggle against Otto of Braunschweig. At this time, he managed to expand his possessions, as well as to find allies thanks to the marriage of two sisters.
{LudwigI_Kelheim_effects_desc}..

{LudwigI_Kelheim2}传记 (2nd part)
{LudwigI_Kelheim2_desc}In 1204, Ludwig married Ludmila Cesky, the widow of one of his opponents, the Bavarian Count Adalbert IV von Bogen. Thanks to this marriage, Ludwig received custody of the minor sons of Ludmila - Bertold III and Adalbert V, strengthened his ties with the Czech king Przemysl Otakar I, uncle Ludmila, and also strengthened the Wittelsbach’s position in the region as opposed to the Austrian Babenbergs. In addition, after the death of the childless Margrave of Wochburg Bertold II in the same year, Ludwig strengthened his position in eastern Bavaria. \n
   June 21, 1208 in Bamberg, the palatine of Bavaria, Otton VIII, cousin of Ludwig, stabbed King Philip of Swabia. The reason for this was that Philip promised Otton the hand of his daughter, but he did not keep the promise. In order to avoid anarchy, on November 15, 1208 at the Reichstag in Frankfurt, the Hohenstaufen party recognized Otton of Braunschweig as 国王Germany. Among those who supported the election of Otton was Ludwig. In gratitude for his support, Otton of Braunschweig recognized Ludwig for all his acquisitions, and also transferred the possessions of the outlawed Palatine of Otto and Margrave of Istria to Heinrich, who helped Otto organize the murder of Philip. \n
   But by the spring of 1211 a coalition had formed of the imperial princes dissatisfied with the emperor Otton. This party was headed by the Czech king Przemysl Otakar I, the Archbishop of Mainz Siegfried and the Landgrave of Thuringia German I. They openly rebelled against the emperor Otton, relying on the authority of the pope and 国王France Philip II Augustus. Despite the fact that the army of the Palatinate Heinrich, brother of the emperor, devastated the possessions of Archbishop Siegfried, the coalition grew. In summer, they were joined by the Duke of Austria Leopold VI and the Duke of Bavaria Ludwig I.

{LudwigI_Kelheim3_desc}In September, they gathered in Nuremberg, where the preliminaries of the new 国王Germany were held. The choice fell on the 国王Sicily Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, the son of the late emperor Henry VI, who was elected 国王Germany and the future emperor. \n
   In December 1212, at the Congress of Imperial Princes in Frankfurt, Frederick II was elected 国王Germany, after which he was crowned in Mainz. His adversary, Otto of Braunschweig, was defeated by the French king Philip II Augustus at Bouvin (July 27, 1214), after which he was forced to finally give way to Frederick and retire to his ancestral lands. \n
   On April 25, 1214, the Elector of the Palatinate Henry VI died. His heirs were two young sisters, but Frederick II gave the Palatinate to Ludwig (who then added a lion to his coat of arms) and his son Otton II, who in 1222 married Agnes, the youngest of the sisters of Henry VI. Later, Frederick II bought from Margrave Herman V of Baden, who married the eldest of the sisters Henry VI, the rights to her part of the inheritance. In 1227, Otton II was declared an adult and was knighted, after which he received the Palatinate. \n
   In 1221, Ludwig led the German army, which went on the Fifth Crusade to Egypt. However, the campaign was unsuccessful, and in August Ludwig was captured by Sultan al-Camil, from whom he was later redeemed.

{LudwigI_Kelheim4}传记 (4th part)
{LudwigI_Kelheim4_desc}In 1225, the Archbishop of Cologne Engelbert I, regent of Germany under the young King Henry, was assassinated while Emperor Frederick II was in Sicily. All the spiritual princes refused the post of regent, and only in July at the Reichstag in Augsburg, after much hesitation, Ludwig decided to accept this post. \n
   In 1227, the former palatine of Henry V died, who recognized in 1223 his nephew, Otton Child, as his heir. At the time of Uncle's death, Otton the Child was held captive, and King Henry and Ludwig tried to take advantage of this to capture Otton's Braunschweig. However, the attempt was unsuccessful, as the city residents closed the gates and were ready to defend, and Henry and Ludwig, fearing the approach of the Danish army, retreated. \n
   In 1228, King Henry quarreled with Ludwig, after which he was forced to resign. And in September 1229, Henry attacked Ludwig, defeating him. During his reign, Ludwig was able to establish himself in Bavaria as an hereditary ruler and strengthen central authority. He managed to prevail with the powerful bishops of Freising, Regensburg, Salzburg, Passau and Augsburg. Ludwig also founded a number of cities: Landshut (1204), which later became the residence of the Bavarian dukes, Straubing (1218), Landau-on-Isar (1224). \n
   On September 15, 1231, Ludwig was killed by unknown persons on the Kelheim Bridge, which is why in historiography he received the nickname "Kelheim". Hohenstaufen was charged with murder. Ludwig inherited his son Otton II.

   The son of Ludwig I of Kelheim. As a result of the marriage of Otto to Agnes, the daughter of Henry V and the granddaughter of Konrad Hohenstaufen, Emperor Frederick II gave the Rhine Palatinate to Otto's father, who transferred the latter to Otto in 1227. In 1231, after the death of Ludwig, Otton also inherited the Duchy of Bavaria. In the same year he moved the Wittelsbach residence to Landshut. \n
   His reign in Bavaria was marked by internal strife over the secular power of the bishops who sought complete independence. The papal party temporarily managed to shake his loyalty to Frederick II, but during the greatest danger, Otton in 1246 gave his daughter Elizabeth to his son Frederick, King Conrad IV, and was his faithful assistant in the fight against Henry Raspe and Wilhelm of Holland, for which he was excommunicated church, and his country was subjected to interdict. When Conrad IV entered Italy in 1251, he appointed Otto the regent of Germany.

{Dietrich_Vettin_desc}Dietrich the Oppressed (1162 - February 18, 1221) - Earl of Weissenfels from 1190, Margrave of Meissen (Dietrich I) from 1198, Margrave of the Netherlands and Earl of Eilenburg and Groich (Dietrich III) from 1210, the second son of Margrave Otton Bogaty and Gedwigt von Gedwitt von Gedwitt von Gedwitt von . \n
   Dietrich enjoyed a greater favor from his mother, Gedwig von Ballenstedt, than his older brother Albrecht the Proud. Under the influence of his wife, Margrave Meissen, Otton the Rich drew up a will according to which the Meissen mark was not to be inherited by his eldest son, Albrecht, but by the second - Dietrich. However, this caused the discontent of Albrecht, who rebelled against his father. As a result, after the death of Otton, Meissen inherited exactly Albrecht. Dietrich was left only Weissenfels in Thuringia. \n
   Dietrich in 1189 went to the Third Crusade as part of the army of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. He returned from the campaign only in 1191, after which he began the struggle with his brother for his father's inheritance. In order to find an ally, Dietrich married Jutte in 1194, the daughter of German Landgrave Thuringia I. In the same year, in alliance with his father-in-law, Dietrich defeated Albrecht near Weissenfels. Albrecht himself escaped from the battlefield, and a number of his knights were captured. However, Dietrich did not achieve greater success, and in 1195 he went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.

{Dietrich_Vettin2_desc}In the same year 1195 Albrecht died. However, Emperor Henry VI refused to transfer the rich Meissen to Dietrich, leaving the brand under his control. \n
   After the unexpected death in 1197 of Emperor Henry VI, Dietrich returned to Germany. In a heated dispute over the crown, Dietrich supported Philip of Swabsky, the brother of the late emperor, who was elected Roman king at the congress of the nobility in Mühlhausen in 1198. In exchange for support, Philip transferred to Dietrich all hereditary paternal possessions, including the Meissen mark. \n
   In the ensuing struggle between Philip of Swabia and Otton of Braunschweig for the imperial crown, Dietrich invariably sided with Philip. But after the assassination in 1208 of Philip of Swabia, Dietrich, like many other supporters of the Hohenstaufen, was forced to admit Otto of Braunschweig as king to avoid anarchy. \n
   In 1210, the Margrave of the Netherlands, Conrad II, died. He did not leave any heirs, and Dietrich demanded his possession, as the closest relative of the late male Margrave. In exchange for this, he promised Otton of Braunschweig 15 thousand marks. As a result, the emperor approved the transfer of land to Konrad Dietrich. At the same time, out of 15 thousand, Dietrich paid only 10 thousand, the emperor allowed Dietrich to keep the rest 5 thousand. As a result, Dietrich’s possessions have seriously increased. He inherited the Netherlands, Rochlitz, Landsberg, Groich, Osterland and Eilenburg.

{Dietrich_Vettin3_desc}At the same time, he had to argue over the rights to Landsberg with the Margraves of Brandenburg, and over the Netherlands, with the Czech king Przemysl Otakar I. The conflict with the Czech king, which fueled the fact that Przemysl Otakar I divorced with his sister Driti. At the initiative of Dietrich, Emperor Otton even declared Przemysl Otakar I deprived of the Czech crown, recognizing King Vratislav, son of Przemysl Otakar I from marriage with his sister Dietrich. \n
   In 1212, Dietrich took the side of the opponent of Otto of Braunschweig - Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, supporting the election of the emperor. However, due to the fact that Frederick recognized the 国王the Czech Republic, Przemysl Otakar I, the personal enemy of Dietrich. Dietrich helped Otton of Braunschweig in the siege of Weissensee, but already in 1213 he finally switched to the side of Frederick II. In exchange for this, Frederick confirmed all the Lenas received by Dietrich, and also transferred a number of possessions. As a result, Dietrich became the most powerful imperial prince in the east of the Holy Roman Empire. \n
   In the last years of the reign of Dietrich, a conflict began with the city of Leipzig. Leipzig was considered the flax of the bishop of Merseburg, but Dietrich tried to increase his influence in the city, but was faced with opposition from its inhabitants. But in 1217, Dietrich still managed to bring the city to submission. He also had to argue over a number of Lenas with the bishops of Meissen, Merseburg and Naumburg. \n
   Dietrich died on February 18, 1221. They suspected that the cause of his death was poisoning. His body was buried in the clan tomb in the Altzell monastery. Inherited by his third son, Henry III Serene.

{LeopoldVI_Babenberg_desc}Leopold VI the Glorious (1176 - 1230) - Duke of Styria from 1194 and Austria from 1198 from the Babenberg dynasty. The son of Archduke Leopold V. Patron of the arts, sciences and religion, one of the richest and most educated rulers of Europe of his time. Under him, the medieval Austrian duchy reached the peak of its power. At the court of Leopold VI, the minnesinger lived. In his possessions, the duke had much more power than the 皇帝Holy Roman Empire. \n
   Leopold VI was the youngest son of the Duke of Austria and Styria Leopold V, and Ilona of Hungary, daughter of King Gesa II. \n
   After the death of his father in 1194, he inherited the Duchy of Styria, but only four years later his older brother Frederick I died, and Leopold VI ascended the throne of Austria. \n
   In his foreign policy, Leopold continued the traditions of his predecessors from the House of the Babenbergs and supported the Hohenstaufen empire in their struggle against the Guelphs. At the same time, he managed to prevent an open break with the pope, which allowed Leopold to act as a mediator in the negotiations between the emperor and the pope. \n
   The authority of the Austrian duke in Germany increased the marriage of the daughter of Leopold VI Margarita and Heinrich Hohenstaufen, son of Emperor Frederick II. In addition to the unsuccessful Czech invasion of Austria in 1226, his government was safe in Leopold VI and did not participate in military conflicts.
{LeopoldVI_Babenberg_effects_desc}..

{LeopoldVI_Babenberg2}传记 (2nd part)
{LeopoldVI_Babenberg2_desc}Leopold VI pursued an active church policy. He supported knightly and mendicant orders, especially the Cistercians, and founded monasteries (Lilienfeld in Lower Austria, 1202). The Duke also took part in the 1212 Albiguian Crusade against the South French heretics, and later fought with the 国王Aragon against the Spanish Moors. \n
   In 1216, Leopold VI went to Egypt as part of the Crusader army during the Fifth Crusade and took part in the capture of Damietta. \n
   The Duke also engaged in the development of trade and craft production in Austria and Styria. Under him, Linz, Ens (1212), Vienna (1221) received city law, which ensured the rapid development of these cities. Vienna under Leopold VI became one of the most important cities in Germany. The growth of trade, especially mediation with the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bavaria and Italy, ensured a significant increase in state revenues, which allowed the duke to conduct extensive construction. In particular, for the first time in the Danube region, Gothic buildings began to be erected (church in Klosterneuburg). At the court of Leopold VI, a whole galaxy of prominent German minnesingers was being created: Walter von der Vogelweide, Neidhart von Royenthal, Ulrich von Liechtenstein. It is likely that it was at the duke's court that the famous "Song of the Nibelungs" was created. \n
   The reign of Leopold VI was the heyday of the medieval Austrian Duchy: the country was experiencing an economic and cultural upswing with a stable international position and the high prestige of the Babenbergs in Europe.

{FriedrichII_Babenberg}传记 (1st part)
{FriedrichII_Babenberg_desc}Frederick II the Warrior (1210 - 1246) - Duke of Austria and Styria since 1230, the last representative of the Babenberg dynasty. During the reign of Frederick II, Austria turned into a territorial duchy virtually independent of the empire, one of the most powerful in Germany. \n
   Frederick II was the youngest son of Leopold VI, Duke of Austria and Styria, and Theodora Angelina, daughter (or niece) of the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II. After the death of his father in 1230, Frederick II, as the only surviving son, inherited the duchies of Austria and Styria. \n
   The reign of Frederick II took place in constant wars and uprisings. Already in 1230, an uprising of ministers led by the clan of the Kuenrigers against the authoritarian rule of the duke broke out in Austria, and Czech troops invaded the country. The Czechs burned Krems and devastated the north-Austrian lands. It was only with great difficulty that Frederick II managed to crush the uprising, and in 1233 the duke made a return invasion of the Czech Republic. The following year, Hungary attacked Austria: the army of Endre II reached Vienna, but then was forced to retreat. In early 1236, Frederick, for his part, launched an invasion of Hungary. \n
   Frederick II is the first Austrian monarch who practically did not participate in the affairs of the Holy Roman Empire, pursuing a completely independent policy in the interests of Austria itself. He did not comply with the requirements of the emperor and refused to take part in meetings of the authorities of the empire. This caused a conflict with Emperor Frederick II. The emperor in 1235 - early 1236 repeatedly called the duke of Austria to court to consider the charges against the charges, but he ignored all the demands of the emperor.
{FriedrichII_Babenberg_effects_desc}..

{FriedrichII_Babenberg2}传记 (2nd part)
{FriedrichII_Babenberg2_desc}In June 1236, the emperor declared disgrace to the Austrian duke and confiscated his possessions in Austria and Styria. The German army invaded Austria, which occupied Vienna in 1237. Emperor Frederick II himself stayed in Vienna from January until mid-April 1237. The duke managed to capture church treasures and take refuge in the castle of Wiener Neustadt. In the meantime, the emperor proclaimed Vienna his son Konrad as the new German king in Vienna and declared Vienna an imperial free city and granted its citizens wide rights of self-government and trade privileges, thereby securing the support of the Viennese merchants. However, the main interests of the emperor lay in Italy, so soon the bulk of the imperial troops left Austria. This took advantage of the Duke Frederick II, who entered into an alliance with the Pope, Bavaria, the Czech Republic and Hungary. By 1239, he managed to regain his possessions and make peace with the emperor, who had serious problems in Italy. \n
   After the restoration of the power of Frederick II, some strengthening of the state was observed in Austria. The duke refused to return to Hungary Moson and Sopron, received for help in repelling the Western campaign of the Mongols in 1241, and also broke off negotiations with the Czech Republic on a dynastic union. Austria and the empire formed an alliance against the Czech-Hungarian bloc: in 1245, negotiations between the duke and the emperor in Verona took place, on which the emperor promised Frederick Krajn the royal title, and in return was to marry the seventeen-year-old niece of the duke Gertrude.
{FriedrichII_Babenberg2_effects_desc}..

{FriedrichII_Babenberg3}传记 (3rd part)
{FriedrichII_Babenberg3_desc}However, the girl refused to marry the fifty-year-old emperor and negotiations broke down. However, in 1245, Frederick II invaded Krajina and, with the consent of her nominal ruler, Patriarch of Aquileia, subjugated the Margrave to his power. \n
   Strengthening the power of the duke caused a response from his neighbors: in 1246, Czech and Hungarian troops entered Austria. The Austrians won the battle on the Leita River, but the Duke of Frederick himself died. \n
   With the death of Frederick II, the Babenberg dynasty, ruling in Austria since 976, died out. Of the Babenbergs, only two women survived: Margarita, the sister of Frederick and the widow of King Henry VII of Hohenstaufen, and Gertrude, the daughter of Heinrich Babenberg, the elder brother of Frederick II. Gertrude in 1246 married Vladislav Moravsky, son of the Czech king Wenceslas I. \n
   According to the Privilegium Minus of 1156, in the absence of male heirs, the throne of Austria was to be transferred through the female line. Vladislav Moravsky immediately put forward his claims, but did not have time to use his right, unexpectedly passed away in January 1247. Meanwhile, the emperor, in violation of the "Privilegium Minus", declared Austria a blackened linen and sent his troops to the duchy, entering Vienna. The Dowager Duchess Gertrude with her supporters fled to Hungary and requested protection from Pope Innocent IV. Under pressure from the pope, Gertrude married in mid-1248, married Margrave Baden Hermann VI, who was recognized as pope by the Duke of Austria and Styria (September 14, 1248).

{HeinrichII_vonNassau_desc}Henry II the Rich (1190 - January 25, 1251) - Earl of Nassau in 1198-1247. \n
   Henry II was the eldest son of Count Walram I of Nassau (c. 1146–1198) and Kunigunda (c. 1135 - after 1189), daughter of Count Gottfried I von Ziegenhain. After the death of his father in 1198, Heinrich became his successor as Count of Nassau. In 1198-1230, his co-ruler was the younger brother, Ruprecht IV, who then joined the Teutonic Order. \n
   In the Holy Roman Empire, Count Heinrich of Nassau was a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. However, in 1209-1211, he supported Otto IV of Braunschweig from the Welfare dynasty, and then switched to the side of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. In the years 1212-1214, Heinrich Nassauski was held captive by his own adversary, the Archbishop of Trier, Theodorich von Weed. \n
   At the end of the 12th century, Count Walram von Nassau was able to strengthen his power in the territory south of the River Lahn. Becoming the heir to the Earls of Arnstein, he received fogtats in Koblenz, Plaffendoref, Nieder-Lanstein and Humbach (Montabaur) in the archbishopric of Trier. But in the 1230s, the Trier archbishops consolidated their influence on the Rhine and Lahn, ousting the counts of Nassau from most of the fogsts of the archbishopric. The Archbishop of Trier around 1217 strengthened Montabaur Castle to protect his lands on the right bank of the Rhine from the Counts of Nassau.

{HeinrichII_vonNassau2_desc}The father of Heinrich the Rich, Valram I received Wiesbaden from the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa as a reward for his support for the emperor in the conflicts of the 1170-1180s. Around 1214, Count Heinrich the Rich expanded his possessions in the vicinity of Wiesbaden, having received from the emperor a wealth in Wiesbaden and the surrounding lands. \n
   Around 1200, Count Heinrich von Nassau and his brother Ruprecht IV began the construction of the Sonnenberg Castle in the Taunus mountains in the vicinity of Wiesbaden. This castle was intended to be protected from the Mainz archbishop and his vassals, the lords Epstein, who owned land on the border with Wiesbaden. However, the chapter of St. Mark in Mainz recognized Sonnenberg the possession of the archbishop. To resolve this dispute, Heinrich Bogaty was forced to pay 30 marks to the head of the capital in 1221 in order to acquire Sonnenberg Castle and its surroundings. In the end, Heinrich Nassau was forced to recognize the sovereignty of the Archbishops of Mainz over Sonnenberg, owning the castle as the Feod of Mainz. \n
   In 1224, Count Heinrich the Rich received support from the Cologne Archbishop Engelbert II, who made the first his marshal and cupbearer. But in return for his protection from the archbishops of Mainz and Trier, Henry Nassau had to cede half of Siegen to the archbishopric of Cologne, but retained his sovereign rights in the region surrounding Siegen.

{HeinrichII_vonNassau3_desc}In 1231, Henry the Rich was present at the imperial parliament in Worms and in 1232 was at the imperial meeting of Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen in Ravenna. \n
   Heinrich's younger brother and co-ruler, Ruprecht IV, joined the Teutonic Order in 1230 and bequeathed his lands to the crusaders. Henry constantly contested the transfer of part of Nassau County to the Teutonic Order. \n
   In 1247, Heinrich Nassausky supported the election of Count William William II of Holland as the German king, who in return approved all imperial possessions for him and granted him the right to mint money. \n
   The policy of Heinrich Nassausky in the Herborn mark angered local aristocratic families. Around 1240, Henry built the castle of Dillenburg to better keep the rebellious vassals in obedience. In 1248, a century-long confrontation began between the counts of Nassauski and the Landgraves of Hesse for the possession of the Herborn mark. \n

{WaleranIII_Limburg2_desc}Together with her possessions, Walram received claims for the Margrave of Namur, which was taken from Heinrich the Blind, father of Ermezinda in 1189. At that time, Philip II de Courtenay, a relative of King Philip II of Augustus of France, ruled over namur. In addition, the death in the same year of the childless elder brother of Henry made Valeran the heir to his father. But two attempts by Valeran to capture Namur (in 1214 and 1216) were unsuccessful. The first stage of the war ended in 1217. This year, Valeran went on the Fifth Crusade, during which he participated in the Battle of Damietta on August 7, 1218. \n
   Valeran returned to his domain from the crusade in 1218. Upon his return, he began a conflict against Engelbert I of Berg, Archbishop of Cologne. The reason was the dispute over inheritance by the county of Berg. The oldest son of Valeran, Henry IV, was married to Irmengard, daughter of Count Adolph V, who died in the siege of Damietta. Berg was to be inherited by Irmengard and her husband Henry, but this was opposed by Archbishop Engelbert, brother of the late Count Adolf, with whom Walram, in alliance with Count Cleve Dietrich V, already clashed in 1216 over possessions in North Eifel, but was March 30, 1217 forced to make peace. The new armed conflict also did not bring Valeran, who, in addition to Count Cleve, also supported his brother-in-law Wilhelm II, Count Julich, did not bring success. However, Valeran, who also renewed the war for Namur against Philip II de Courtenay, did not have enough strength to win. And after his ally, Count Cleve Dietrich was defeated on June 20, 1220, Valeran went into peace talks with Engelbert.

{WaleranIII_Limburg3_desc}As a result, in August in Cologne he was forced to conclude a new peace treaty with Engelbert, who retained control of Berg, however, Henry and Irmengard should have inherited Berg after the death of the archbishop. \n
   In 1221, the Duke of Limburg, Henry III, father of Valeran, who inherited his possessions - the Duchy of Limburg and the county of Arlon, died, annexing them to Luxembourg, La Roche and Darby. On February 13, 1223, Valeran was forced by the Dinan Treaty to renounce his rights to Namur. \n
   In 1224, Valeran, in alliance with Count Geldern Gerhard III, participated in the war against Bishop Utrecht Otton. \n
   On November 7, 1225, Engelbert was killed by Count Alten and Isenberg of Frederick II, son-in-law of Valeran, after which Berg came under the control of Irmengard and Heinrich. It has not been documented to establish whether Valeran, who benefited from the death of Engelbert, was among the organizers of the murder, but this is opposed by the fact that the new Archbishop of Cologne, Heinrich Mülenarksky, who investigated the murder of his predecessor with all severity, did not bring charges against Valeran. \n
   In 1226, Valeran escorted to Italy the young king Henry VII, the son of Emperor Frederick II, and on his return from there on July 2 he died at Rolduk Abbey. The possessions of Valeran were divided between his sons from two marriages. Limburg received the eldest son from his first marriage, Henry, already owning Berg. The second son of Valeran received Monschau, the inheritance of his mother. The possessions of Ermezinda of Luxembourg were to be inherited by her sons from Valeran, Henry Belokuriy and Gerhard.

Such an ideal base for the invasion could be the county of Pontier. Therefore, he had a plan - to marry Jeanne, the eldest daughter and heiress of Simon. After Simon and Maria agreed to the marriage, Henry requested papal permission to marry - since Jeanne was Henry's close relative, permission was necessary. \n
   However, Blanca of Castile intervened in Henry's marriage plans. She sent a formal complaint to Rome, reporting that the marriage of Henry and Jeanne is unacceptable under canon law. In addition, Blanca, on behalf of her son-king, reminded Simon of the promise made to King Louis VIII not to give her older daughters marriage without royal consent, threatening to deprive Simon and Mary of possessions again in case of marriage.

Pierre I was the second cousin of King Louis VIII of France. Despite his royal origin, as a representative of the younger branch, Pierre did not have great prospects. But the 国王France needed a loyal ruler of Brittany, and therefore Louis married Pierre to the heiress of the duchy. \n
  Pierre I during his reign was able to bring Brittany out of the influence of both England and France. He tried to strengthen the ducal power by weakening the power of the Breton bishops. For this he received his nickname. In 1217, Pierre de Dreux began the struggle for power with the Bishop of Nantes. \n
  For this policy, he was repeatedly excommunicated by local bishops, and from 1218 until January 28, 1220 he was excommunicated by Pope Honorius III. \n
  After the death of his wife in 1221, he became regent with his son Jean. In 1226, Louis VIII died and the crown passed to his underage son. Large feudal lords decided to take advantage of this, seeking to weaken the king’s power. The opposition to Louis IX and his mother Blanca of Castile was led by Thibault IV Champagne, Pierre Moklerk of Brittany and Hugo X de Lusignan, Count de La March. The barons conspired with the 国王England and began to strengthen their castles.

{PierreeI_deDre2_desc}The decisive action of the Forms of Castile led to Thibault IV Champagne going over to the side of Louis IX. And after this, the counts of Breton and Mars were summoned to parliament and the royal court. \n
   They appeared, but only after serious threats. Pierre Moklerk signed an agreement under which he pledged to extradite his daughter Yolanda for the eight-year-old Jean, brother of Louis IX. But in 1228, Pierre Moklerk of Brittany and Hugo X de Lusignan, Count of March, again rebelled, calling for the transfer of the regency to the uncle of the king Philip Jurpel. \n
   Henry III intervened in the war and sent his brother Richard to help the barons, but he, disappointed in the French barons, returned to England. In 1230, after the landing of Henry III in Saint-Malo, Pierre I of Breton swore allegiance to him. Louis IX declared the Duke of Breton deposed, and concluded an armistice with England for three years. After the armistice, Pierre I of Breton, finding no military support from Henry III, made peace with Louis IX, passing the fortress king Bellem, Saint-Jacques-de-Bevron and Pierre-en-Persh, and promising to go on a crusade as soon as his son will become an adult. \n
   Having transferred the duchy of Brittany to his son Jean I in 1237, he went on a crusade, leaving the successors a strong ducal authority, and Brittany - his ancestral symbol, ermine. Pierre accompanied King Louis IX on a crusade in 1249 and was captured on April 6, 1250, after being wounded in the battle of Mansour. He died at sea while returning to Western Europe.

Philip II ordered Herve to refrain from atrocities. Outwardly, the Count obeyed, but continued to condone the enemies of the monastery, ignoring all the complaints of the abbot. As a result, the desperate abbot Gauthier complained to Pope Innocent III in 1211, who on November 13, 1211 sent the bishop of Paris, Robert de Curson, to excommunicate Count Herve from the church and, if necessary, impose an interdict on his possessions if King Philip fails for two months to get him to sign a peace with the abbey. However, even this threat did not work, as a result of which Herve remained under excommunication until the end of 1213. In order to force Herve to peace, the pope had to resort to another means. According to an agreement concluded between Herve and Abbot Gauthier on April 12, 1213, with the mediation of Pope Innocent, Count Nevera could appear in Vezle monastery only twice a year - on Easter and on the day of the feast of Mary Magdalene, and then the monks were obliged to compensate him because of his authority a hundred livres.

He participated in the siege of Damietta, however, learning about the death of Pierre de Courtenay, Herve left the army of the crusaders and went to France.

He managed to take Tonner without any problems, and Philip II, Margrave Namur, son of Pierre II from his second marriage, and Robert de Courtenay, brother of Pierre II, presented claims to Auxerre. But with the support of Pope Honorius II, the county of Auxerre was transferred to Herve. At the same time, Herve faced the resistance of Bishop Auxerre Guillaume de Seniel, but after he went to Paris in 1220, Herve stormed the city of Auxerre. According to the Chronicle of the Bishops of Osser, the city was plundered, and most of the townspeople, fearing Herve’s brutality and atrocities, fled. \n

He was the great-grandson of Raimund IV de Saint-Gilles, the 英雄the first crusade. Having married his first marriage to Ermessind de Pele in 1172, he received in a dowry the county of Melgay, whose overlord was the Holy See; in 1211, Pope Innocent III took this land. After the death of Ermessinda in 1176, in 1180 he married Beatrice de Beziers, daughter of Raimund I Trancavel, Viscount Beziers. In 1196 he was excommunicated for the persecution of the monks of the abbey of Saint-Gilles, but in 1198 the excommunication was withdrawn. \n
   During the reign of Raimund, the majority of the population in Languedoc professed the religion of the Cathars, called here the Albigensians. The local nobility and personally the count were largely sympathetic to the Cathars. However, the Holy See did not approve of this. Especially zealous adversary of the Cathars was Innocent III, who became pope since 1198. He excommunicated Raimund, after which the count promised to stop patronizing the Cathars, was forgiven, but he did not keep his promise. The last straw was the death in 1208 of the papal legate Pierre de Castelno at the hands of the count clerk. Although the count’s involvement in this crime was not proven, it was of no interest to anyone. In 1208, Pope again excommunicated Raimund and called for a campaign on his land, which went down in history as the Albiguian Crusade.

{RaymonddVI_deTolosa2_desc}Raimund VI, not daring to raise a weapon in defense of the Qatari church and not completely confident in his vassals, did not resist. In June 1209, he agreed to attend a humiliating ceremony of public repentance in Saint-Gilles. In the same place, he promised to give his father seven castles and fulfill all his requirements. At first, he even personally joined the crusaders, but soon came into conflict with the papal legates Arnold Amalric and Milon because of their too cruel, in his opinion, requirements for Toulouse. The legates excommunicated him; Pope removed the excommunication after the Count personally came to Rome, but the ongoing provocations from the legates forced Raimund to openly break with the Catholic camp in 1211. \n
   Raimund VI led the defense of Toulouse and was able to withstand the first siege. Then he turned for help to his wife’s brother, 国王Aragon Pedro II. He came and took the city under his protection, but in 1213 he was defeated by the crusaders at the Battle of Muir. After this, Raimund with his son could only escape to England, to the court of John the Landless. In 1214, he formally submitted to dad.

{SanchoVII_Silnyj_desc}Sancho VII the Strong died on April 17, 1234 - 国王Navarre since 1194, son of King Sancho VI and Sanchi of Castile. Had a height of 223 cm. \n
   In 1195, a conflict broke out between Navarra and Castile due to the fact that Sancho did not have time to lead his troops to the battle of Alarcos, and the Castilians were defeated. Alphonse VIII accused Sancho of defeat and started a war against him, but was defeated. In 1200, Sancho embarked on a military expedition against the Moors, marched through Murcia, Andalusia, and even invaded Africa. Taking advantage of his absence, Castile and Aragon dismembered the Kingdom of Navarre, capturing Alava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay. According to the Guadalajara Peace Agreement of 1207, Sancho was forced to admit all territorial losses. Later, Sancho made a decisive contribution to the victory of the Christian coalition army over the Almohad troops on July 16, 1212 at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. Behind the Almohad troops there was a camp in the center of which was the tent of their leader Muhammad al-Nasir (Christians called him Miramamolin). The tent was guarded by his personal guard, which consisted of thousands of African slaves who were chained together (according to one legend, it was golden) and surrounded the tent of his master, forming a living wall, which protected from a possible attack.

{SanchoVII_Silnyj2}传记 (2nd part)
{SanchoVII_Silnyj2_desc}At one of the decisive moments of the battle, the 国王Navarre and his knights managed to get close to the tent of the leader of the Almohad, but they could not overcome the dense wall of the guards chained by chains. Then Sancho cut these chains and on his horse broke through to the tent, dragging the Navarra with him. Seeing this success, others rushed to their aid. Muhammad al-Nasir sat in the tent reading the Qur'an, and on his head was a large white turban with a huge green emerald in the center. \n
   Muhammad al-Nasir, seeing that he was defeated, jumped on his horse and fled in horror. A panic broke out in the Almohad army and, soon, the rest of the army fled. After this battle, Sancho received a coat of arms in the form of a scarlet shield with intersecting gold chains and a green emerald in the center. Childless Sancho became the last representative of the male line of the Jimenez dynasty, who ruled in Navarre from the beginning of the X century. After his death, his nephew Thibault, son of Blanca and Count of Champagne, was elected 国王Navarra.

{RaymondddVII_deTolosa_desc}Raimund VII (1197 - 1249) - Count of Toulouse, since 1222.
   In 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council deprived him of all land rights in favor of Simon de Montfort, leader of the Albiguian Crusade, condemning his father for supporting heretic Cathars, leaving the future Raimund VII only the right to inherit the Marquise of Provence. In May 1216, both Raimundas, taking advantage of Monfort's departure to Ильle-de-France to bring homage to King Philippe Augustus, landed in Marseilles to revolt and regain their lands. Languedoc rose to fight. At first, Montfort managed to pacify Toulouse, but on September 13, 1217, Raimund VI rejoined it, and soon his son joined him. \n
   Montfort died in 1218 while trying to return Toulouse, Raimund VII fought against Amory de Montfort, the son of Simon. With the death of his father in 1222, Raimund inherited all his possessions and began to conquer them with the help of faithful vassals, counts of Foix. Amory, unable to interfere with him, in 1219 turned to the king for help, and he sent an army under the command of Prince Louis, the future Louis VIII. He first took the city of Marmande, having organized a terrible massacre there, and on June 19 he approached Toulouse. The siege, in which Raimund Jr. personally led the defense, lasted until August 1, when Louis escaped from under the walls. After this, Raimund freely regained all possessions, even the county of Carcassonne. In the year 01224, Amory VI de Montfort, realizing the hopelessness of his situation, renounced the right to land in favor of the French crown. Cardinal Romain, a papal legate in France, in the interests of the king put pressure on the cathedral in Bourges, held in 1225, and he excommunicated Raimund VII from the church, although the count promised to obey the king and fight the Cathars.

{RaymondddVII_deTolosa2}传记 (2nd part)
{RaymondddVII_deTolosa2_desc}King Louis VIII, in the spring of 1226 moved on a new crusade to the South. Seniors and cities were in a hurry to surrender to him, only Avignon held on for three months. However, before reaching Toulouse, the king fell ill with dysentery and died suddenly in November 1226. Humber de God, not daring to besiege Toulouse, set about devastating the surrounding countryside. However, the forces were too unequal, since Toulouse could no longer count on outside help. Legat Romain, through the abbot Helselv, proposed to Raimund VII peace negotiations, and on December 10, 1228 a preliminary agreement was signed in Bazierz, and then the count went to the city of Moe near Paris to sign the final peace. Raimund was initially in the position of the vanquished. \n
   First of all, he was excommunicated, and the signing of the contract was preceded by a humiliating scene of repentance before the church, which he performed in Notre Dame Cathedral, after which he was returned to the bosom of the church. The treaty at Mo was signed on April 12, 1229. According to his conditions, Raimund VII again recognized himself as a vassal of King Louis IX, lost half of the territory. But the worst thing for him was that he was obligated to give his only daughter Jeanne (who was then nine years old) for the royal brother Alfons Puatevinsky, who was to inherit all his lands; in the event that the marriage is childless, all possessions were transferred to the French crown. This marked the end of the independent county of Toulouse. Raimund also pledged to pursue heretics on his lands, pay large sums to a number of abbeys, demolish fortifications in many cities, and fund Toulouse University. Inquisition was introduced on its lands. The signing of the treaty at Mo is considered the official date for the completion of the Albiguian Crusade.

{RaymondddVII_deTolosa3}传记 (3rd part)
{RaymondddVII_deTolosa3_desc}Outwardly resigned, Raimund VII tried to find a way out of the situation with the help of a new marriage in order to expand his possessions, or even acquire a male heir, which in principle would make it possible to challenge the agreement in Mo. In 1241, he divorced his wife Sancha of Aragon, the daughter of the 国王Aragon, in order to marry again and have an heir. This was actively opposed in Rome. In 1240, Raimund VII did not support the revolt of the Viscount Bezier Raimund II, who was trying to regain the county of Carcassonne, subordinate to the king by agreement in Mo; True, he did not help the royal army to crush the rebellion, but she managed it herself. \n
   However, in 1242 he joined the league created against King Hugo X Lusignan, which included many southern barons and which was supported by the 国王England Henry III. But the French king inflicted a league defeat at Taibur and Sent in the same year, and Raimund VII was forced to make peace with him again on Lorris on October 30. During the suppression of the last outbreak of Qatari resistance in the castle of Montsegur in 1243, he virtually remained neutral without help neither the besieged, nor the royal army. However, most likely the entire struggle of the South against royal power was almost exhausted. In 1247, Raimund accepted the cross, in 1248 was present at the departure of Louis IX on the seventh crusade from Aigues-Mortes, but he did not manage to fulfill the crusade vow, because he died on September 27, 1249. According to his will, he was buried in the abbey of Fontevro, the burial place of the Plantagenets, their maternal ancestors.

{AmauryVI_deMonfor2}传记 (2nd part)
{AmauryVI_deMonfor2_desc}Being a brave warrior, according to the testimonies of Peter Cerneysky and other contemporaries, Amori did not shine with the talents of the commander. He was forced to leave Toulouse and retreat. In battles with the troops of Raimund VII of Toulouse, Amory's army suffered several serious defeats, as a result of which he lost a significant part of the territories conquered by the crusaders. Seeing Amory’s difficulties, the 国王France, Philip II Augustus, sent an army to help him under the command of his son, Prince Louis, the future king Louis VIII Leo. Under pressure from the Pope, Honorius Amory was forced to recognize the king’s right to Languedoc and cede his sovereignty over Toulouse to Raymond Young. He managed to keep only Carcassonne, and then for a short time. On January 15, 1224, Amory ceded Carcassonne to the troops of the Earl of Toulouse, and a month later officially transferred his Languedoc possessions to the 国王France. \n
   In exchange for recognition of royal sovereignty, Amory received the title of France’s constable. In this capacity, he took part in the campaign of Louis against Toulouse and even for some time served as the royal governor in Albigeois, although he had no real power. \n
   Subsequently, Amory de Montfort took part in the Crusade of 1239.对抗:Muslims at Gaza, he was captured and imprisoned in Cairo, where he spent two years awaiting a ransom. Being finally bought from captivity, he went to France, but died on the way to Otranto in 1241, at the age of 49.

{Bouchard_deAvena2}传记 (2nd part)
{Bouchard_deAvena2_desc}Soon Margaret's elder sister, Jeanne of Constantinople, Countess of Flanders and Hainaut (Gennegau), condemned this marriage, considering it unacceptable, since Bouchard was a child dedicated to the service of God and was appointed protodeacon. Pope Innocent III, dissolved the fourth Lateran Council of 1215. Despite this, Bouchard and Margarita fled to Luxembourg and continued to live together. From this marriage, they had three children. However, in 1219, Jeanne captured Bouchard and imprisoned in Ghent. Where he was released in 1221 on the condition that he divorces his wife.

{GugoIII_deBo}传记 (1st part)
{GugoIII_deBo_desc}Hugo III de Beau (d. 1239/1240) - Senior de Beau, Viscount of Marseille. Founder of the senior line of the house of de Bo. The eldest son of Bertrand I de Bo, Prince of Orange, and Tiburga (II) of Orange. \n
   He inherited the castles of Bo, Trenketay and others, which formed the basis of the lord de Bo. In 1195 he married Barral, the daughter of the Viscount of Marseille, and became his heir. At first, he maintained good relations with his neighbors, he even accompanied Pedro II of Aragon on a trip to Rome in 1204 for the royal crown. \n
   Even with the Count of Provence, the relationship was good: on October 8, 1206, Alphonse II gave him the fossils of Mossan and Mourier, and approved for him all the possessions in the Marseilles county, which he held by the right of his wife; they even entered into an alliance and mutual assistance treaty. Establishing power in Marseille was not easy. When his father-in-law Barral died in 1208, the Marseilles removed from the monastery of Saint-Victor his abbot, brother Barral Ronselen, and proclaimed him the lord of the city. Hugo turned to Pope Innocent III, and he excommunicated Ronselen and threatened the Marseilles with the same if they did not return Hugo his inheritance. \n
   At this time, the Albiguian wars began, which split Provence and cost the lives of Hugo's brother Guillaume of Orange. The Marseilles sympathized with the Languedoc’s struggle for freedom, supported Raymond VII of Toulouse and had a difficult relationship with the Count of Provence. In 1216, the uprising of Marseille, Arles, Avignon and Nice began. In 1222, Archbishop Arles excommunicated the Marseilles from the church. Hugo joined the alliance of rebellious cities.
{GugoIII_deBo_effects_desc}..

{GugoIII_deBo2}传记 (2nd part)
{GugoIII_deBo2_desc}Under pressure from Emperor Frederick II, peace was concluded between the Count of Provence and Marseille through the mediation of Guillaume, Count of Geneva, on December 23, 1229, after the treaty in Moe, which put an end to the Albiguian War. Hugo III de Beau ceded to the Count of Provence his rights to the city of Saint-Genies and the seigneur Rockver, and undertook to refrain from any coalition with any city if this could harm the count. \n
   The agreement did not last long. On November 7, 1230, the Syndics of Marseille recognized Raymond VII of Toulouse as their lord, and Hugo de Beau witnessed this act on December 2. Then, in alliance with his nephew Raymond de Berr, he participated in the war against Raymond Berengaria IV, who defeated him, captured him, imprisoned him in Aix and confiscated his lands and castles (1231). \n
   The continuation of this enmity violated the plans of Frederick II, who wanted to put an end to her in order to use the troops of Provence in the crusade. It was decided that the best mediator in the negotiations with the Count of Toulouse would be Hugo himself, therefore, on July 14, 1231, an agreement was signed on his release on bail of a thousand marks in silver. The syndics of Arles and Podestival Percival Doria vouched for this amount for Hugo. The war, however, did not stop. On September 19, 1232, the emperor instructed Caius de Gourzano, his confidant in Provence, to obtain at least a truce from his opponents, threatening to be called to court and subjected to imperial disgrace. Gurzano also decided to use Hugo, and on May 14, 1233 agreed with the Count of Provence to release him already for 1,500 marks in silver, to which amount Hugo added castles of Castella, Bo and Aigius.
{GugoIII_deBo2_effects_desc}..

{GugoIII_deBo3}传记 (3rd part)
{GugoIII_deBo3_desc}Having freed himself, he held successful negotiations with Raymond VII of Toulouse, and in return received from the Count of Provence, along with ultimate freedom, the return of lands and castles that were confiscated (1233). \n
   Raymond VII of Toulouse took advantage of this pause to ask Pope for the return of Comte Venessen in 1234. He was supported in this demand by Louis IX, who in May 1234 married Margaret, daughter of Raymond Berengaria, as well as Frederick II, who made a sharp turn in his policy, speaking out against Rome. After the pope's evasive answer, the Count of Toulouse decided to restore justice himself: he crossed the Rhone, despite the excommunication to which he was subjected (August 4, 1234), besieged and took Tarascon, and then went to Italy to Frederick II, who next month, with a diploma issued in Montefiascon, he gave him fief imperial lands belonging to the house of Saint-Gilles and for eight years under the control of the church. \n
   After receiving the investment, Raymond returned to Provence, and his troops, under the command of the Seneschal in Venessen, Barral de Beau (son of Hugo), also excommunicated on this occasion, occupied this area. The war ended in 1237 with a treaty under which Raymond committed himself to the pope to give his only daughter Jeanne to Alfonso de Poitiers. \n
   Hugo himself caused all these wars considerable damage. He was forced to sell a number of castles, cities and other possessions in order to pay creditors.

   He first appeared in the sources in January 1203, when his father, Raimund Roger, married him to Ermezind, the daughter of his ally Arno I, Viscount de Castelbon and de Cerdan. Seeing in this marriage a threat to their interests, Bishop of Urhel Bernat de Vilamour and Count of Urhel Ermengol VIII united and attacked Raimund Roger and Arno, capturing them in February 1203, in which they remained until September. They were freed only thanks to the intervention of 国王Aragon Pedro II, who was interested in an alliance with the Count of Foix to conquer Occitania. \n
   During the Albiguian Wars, Roger Bernard helped his father in the fight against the Montforts. In 1217, he defended Montgrenier Castle for 6 weeks from attacks by the army of Simon de Montfort. In 1218, he distinguished himself during the defense of Toulouse, captured on September 13, 1217 by the army of Raimund VI of Toulouse, from the army of Simon, who died under the walls of the city on June 25. In 1220, Roger Bernard helped his father in the capture of Lavor and Puyloran, and also took an active part in the reconquest of his father's possessions lost during the Albiguian Crusade. Before his death, Raimund Roger did not have time to return only Mirepua, having died on March 27, 1223 during his siege. Having become a count, Roger Bernard managed to finish the siege begun by his father.

{RogeII_deFoix2_desc}In 1224, Roger Bernard, along with Raimund VII, besieged Carcassonne, which was held by Amory de Montfort. And on September 14, peace was concluded between the crusaders and the Occitan, while the Occitan reconciled with the church. \n
   In 1225, the cathedral in Bordeaux excommunicated from the church of Raimund VII of Toulouse. And in 1226, Louis personally led a new crusade. Not wanting to expose their possessions to the dangers of a new war, the Occitan feudal lords sided with the king, opening him the gates of their cities. Only the city of Avignon tried to resist, the siege of which lasted 3 months. Roger Bernard went to Avignon to Louis to try on behalf of Raimund VII to make peace, but the king refused to accept it. The Count of Foix had to fight with the Count of Toulouse against the army of Louis. However, Louis never reached Toulouse, having become ill with dysentery, after which he died in November 1226. Seneschal Humber de Bozhe, appointed commander of the crusader army Blanca of Castile, widow of Louis VIII and regent with his young son Louis IX, did not dare to besiege Toulouse and began to devastate the surrounding countryside. Roger Beranard led the resistance to the crusaders, but the forces were not equal. In addition, in March or April 1227, he was excommunicated. As a result, in 1229, the feudal lords laid down their arms one after another. Earl of Toulouse, Raimund VII, was the first to leave, concluding an agreement with the king in the city of Moe near Paris, having bought peace on humiliating conditions.

He returned his share of the pareage to Pamme, Saverdun, as well as several enclaves in Carcassonne, which had become an agreement under the Treaty of Mo Seneschalism. However, the rights of the lord Mirepua were transferred to Guy de Levy, one of the crusaders. Also with Roger Bernard was removed and excommunication. \n
   In 1239, he reconciled with the church. \n
   In 1240, a revolt broke out in Occitania against French rule, led by Raimund II Trenkavel, Viscount Beziers, who wanted to return the contractual loss to Mo Carcassonne. However, Roger Bernard did not support his relative, trying to agree on a peace. \n

{LouissIX_Capet_desc}Louis IX Saint (April 25, 1214 - August 25, 1270) - 国王France in 1226-1270. Son of Louis VIII Leo and the Blanca of Castile. Representative of the Capetian dynasty. Head of the 7th and 8th Crusades. Canonized by the Catholic Church (1297). \n
  The mother of Louis Blanca of Castile, an intelligent, strong-willed and religious woman, had a huge influence on her son. After the death of her husband, she became regent and was able to strengthen the authority of the royal power. Beautiful and graceful, Louis was interested in his youth in various knightly amusements. In 1234, he married Margarita, daughter of Count Raimund Berenguer IV of Provence. \n
  The English king Henry III Plantagenet tried to regain the possessions of his ancestors (the area according to Garonne), but Louis won at Taliebourg (1242). Guided by the principles of justice, he did not take advantage of the victory and, contrary to the opinion of his advisers, ceded to Henry part of the lands taken from England under Philip II Augustus. In 1244, the French king became seriously ill and vowed to lay the cross upon himself. Having received a banner in Saint-Denis, a bandage and a pilgrim’s staff and requested the blessing of Pope Innocent IV in Lyon, Louis and the Crusaders arrived in Cyprus in September 1248, and Damietta, taken on June 6, in Egypt in the spring of 1249. Moving on, Louis approached Mansour (1250), but the forces of the crusaders were weakened by strife and unrest. \n
  During the retreat to Damietta, the Saracens caught up with Louis and captured him; the king paid off with a huge amount of money and the return of Damietta. In May 1250, Louis sailed from Egypt, but remained 4 years (1250-1254) in Syria, waiting for new crusaders. Louis supported Christians in Palestine, established relations with Asian sovereigns, strengthened Jaffa, Caesarea and Sidon.

Louis respected the rights of his vassals, although he was no longer the first between equals, but sovereign. He did a lot for the reform of the court. Louis eliminated the shortcomings of the feudal system, which did not allow a supreme court in the kingdom, establishing as a general principle the right of the king to intervene in the affairs of his subjects. He banned judicial combat and private wars; dissatisfied with the decision of the local courts received the right to appeal to the royal court. There is a story about how, after the Mass, Louis left the palace, sat down under an oak tree and listened to complaints. \n
  Under Louis, the king's judicial power expanded significantly; the central judicial institution was the Paris Parliament, which consisted of peers and lawyers. All branches of the administration were under the watchful supervision of Louis. Legists were very influential, whose activities greatly contributed to the expansion of royal power. Under Louis, a compilation of customary law and laws was issued in his reign (Etablissements de St. Louis). Louis defended the interests of France with dignity from the claims of Rome. The French clergy stood more for Louis and for the interests of secular power than for the papal throne. In March 1269, Louis promulgated the “Pragmatic Sanction,” which protected the independence of the French church from Rome, destroyed money dues and contributions in favor of the Roman court, etc. During the struggle of Frederick II Staufen with Innocent IV, Louis openly condemned the actions of the pope. \n
  In 1254, the conversion system was improved: the country was now subdivided into twenty clearly defined districts led by royal officials - bali. Balli now passing their posts by inheritance, formed real dynasties. But strict and centralized control over their activities remained.

{LouissIX_Capet3_desc}In 1263, the monetary system was streamlined: now royal coins, unlike local coins, were circulated throughout France. \n
  In 1239, Pope Gregory IX ordered that all copies of the Talmud be taken from the Jews. In this regard, Louis IX organized a “dispute between Christians and Jews” in 1240, according to which the holy book of the followers of Judaism was condemned. In 1242, 22 carts were burned in Paris with Talmuds seized from Jews; subsequently several times smaller actions were repeated. The failure of the Seventh Crusade did not dampen the enthusiasm of Louis IX, who in 1267 received permission from Pope Clement IV to go on a military expedition to the Holy Land. In March 1270, he went to Tunisia, hoping for the conversion of 哈里发Muhammad I al-Mustansirav to Christianity. Waiting for the arrival of Count of Provence and 国王Sicily Charles I of Anjou with military assistance, Louis was inactive. Epidemics began in the crusader army; the son of Louis Jean Tristan died, and on August 3 Louis himself fell ill. However, the sick king still continued to lead the army and even received the ambassadors of the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Paleolog. \n
  On August 25, 1270, Louis IX died suddenly, and after 2 days, his son Dauphin Philippe was proclaimed the new 国王France. \n
  The body of Louis IX was transported by his younger brother Karl of Anjou to Sicily and buried in the cathedral of Montreal, where even now in the altar dedicated to Louis, an urn with its insides is stored. Subsequently, the remains of Louis were transferred to Saint-Denis.

{Donald_ofScotland}传记
{Donald_ofScotland_desc}Donald - ruler of the Kingdom of the Islands in the 1209-1250s, founder of the largest Scottish clan MacDonald. \n
   After the death of Ranald, 国王the Islands in 1164-1209, his possessions were divided between two sons - Donald and Ruairi. The southern part of the Hebrides (Islay, Jura, Colonsay, Oronsay), as well as Koval and, possibly, some lands in Ardnamerhan departed for Donald. \n
   In 1209, he and his brother fought with the inhabitants of the Isle of Skye, and in 1212 Donald raided the Irish city of Derry, continuing the traditions of his Viking ancestors. In the 1210s, Donald may have made a visit to Norway, receiving from the Norwegian king, overlord of the Hebrides, confirmation of his status as 国王the Islands. \n
   The years 1221-1222 include the first attempt by Scotland to establish its authority over the west coast. King Alexander II invaded Argyll and Kintyre. The result of this campaign was the loss by the kings of the Koval Islands, which came under the control of the Stuarts, as well as the transfer of Kintyre, previously owned by Ruairi, to Donald. The influence of Scotland on the kingdom of the Islands increased dramatically, on the coast were built fortresses Dumbarton, Tarbert and Danoon, which became the strongholds of the penetration of central authority in the Gaelic regions of the west. \n
   Nothing is known about the date of Donald's death. Apparently, it happened in the 1250s, since under 1263 his son Angus More was already mentioned as the 国王the Islands.

{RobertV_Bruce}传记 (1st part)
{RobertV_Bruce_desc}Robert V Bruce - 5th Lord Annandale, Scottish Baron of the Bruce clan, one of the main contenders for the crown of Scotland at the end of the 13th century. \n
   Robert Bruce was the son of Robert Bruce, 4th Lord Annandale, and Isabella of Scotland, daughter of David Huntingdon, grandson of 国王Scotland David I.
   The estate of Robert Bruce included hereditary flax in the Annan Valley in the southwestern part of Scotland and a number of estates in the English county of Durham. As one of Scotland's largest tycoons, Robert actively participated in the struggle for power during the minority of King Alexander III. Exiled from the regency council by the Kominov party, Robert Bruce tried to find support from England and participated in the struggle of Henry III with Simon de Montfort. However, Robert did not receive real help from the English king. \n
   The maternal ancestors of Robert Bruce were the kings of Scotland. At the beginning of the reign of Alexander III, before his son was born to the king, Robert was even unofficially recognized as heir to the throne. In 1286, Alexander III died without leaving male descendants. In Scottish state law, there were no clear rules for the inheritance of the kingdom by women by then. According to one point of view, the granddaughter of Alexander III, three-year-old Margaret of Norway, was supposed to be the queen. Robert Bruce and his supporters advocated the inadmissibility of the transfer of the throne to a woman. Nevertheless, most of the country's barons expressed support for Margarita, who was recognized as the Queen of Scotland.

{RobertV_Bruce2}传记 (2nd part)
{RobertV_Bruce2_desc}In 1290, Margaret died, which reopened the question of the succession of the Scottish throne. The main applicants were: \n
-Robert Bruce, son of David Huntingdon's second daughter, \n
-Joann Balliol, grandson of David's eldest daughter, \n
-Floris V, Earl of Holland, a descendant of the sister of David, \n
-Erik II, 国王Norway, father of the deceased queen. \n
The dispute was referred to the English king Edward I. A lengthy trial ended in 1292 with the recognition of John Balliol by the 国王Scotland. Having been defeated, Robert Bruce transferred his inheritance rights to his grandson Robert, who would later lead the struggle for independence of the country and in 1306 he would be crowned 国王Scotland.

{AfonsoooIII_afPortugal_desc}Afonso III of Boulogne (May 5, 1210, Coimbra - February 16, 1279, Coimbra) - the fifth 国王Portugal since 1247. Son of Afonso II and his wife Urraca of Castile. Afonso took control of his brother, King Sanshu II. \n
   Since Afonso was the second son, he was not raised as the heir to the throne, and no one expected him to ascend the throne, which was intended for Sanshu. Afonso lived mainly in France, where he married the rich heiress Matildev in 1238, and thus became the Earl of Boulogne. \n
   In 1246, the conflict between the church and his older brother became unbearable, and Pope Innocent IV ordered the removal of Sansha, replacing him with the Earl of Boulogne. Afonso did not oppose the pope and went to Portugal. Since Sanshu was not a popular monarch, fulfilling the order was not difficult. Sanshu was banished to Castile, and Afonso III became king in 1247. To enter the throne, he had to renounce the title of Count of Boulogne and divorce Matilda. \n
   Deciding not to repeat his brother’s mistakes, Afonso paid close attention to the state of affairs, opinions and complaints of average traders and small landowners. In 1254, in the city of Leiria, Afonso III collects the first Cortes, the royal general assembly, which includes the nobility, the middle merchants and representatives of all municipalities. He also issues a code of laws restricting the possibility of harassment by the nobility of a less privileged population.

{AfonsoooIII_afPortugal2_desc}Having gone down in history as an outstanding administrator, Afonso III founded several cities and granted city charters to many existing settlements, as well as reorganized the state administration apparatus. \n
   Having established himself on the throne, Afonso III continued the war with the Muslim communities, still sprawling in the south. During his reign, the Algarve became part of the kingdom following the capture of Faro, and Portugal thus became the first Iberian kingdom to complete the Reconquista. \n
   Having successfully completed the war with the Moors, Afonso III was still to resolve the difficult political situation on the border with Castile. The neighboring kingdom regarded the Algarve as a zone of its interests, and not part of Portugal. This situation also led to a series of wars between countries. Ultimately, in 1267, an agreement was signed in Badajoz on the southern borders between Castile and Portugal, defined by the Guadiana River. \n

{PedroI_afPortugal}传记 (1st part)
{PedroI_afPortugal_desc}Pedro I (1187 - June 2, 1258) is the infant of Portugal, the titular Earl of Urhelsky, the lord of the Balearic Islands. \n
   Pedro was the son of the Portuguese king Sanshu I and Dulcinea Berenguer. After the death of his father, he took the side of the sisters Mafalda, Sansha and Teresa in the fight against his older brother - the new king Afonso II. Taking advantage of the fact that Teresa became Queen of Leon, he used her territory to attack the Portuguese border province of Traz-u-Montish and Altu Douro, but eventually admitted defeat and was permanently expelled from Portugal. \n
   After this, Pedro became a mercenary in the service of the Almohad 哈里发Yusuf II, commanding a detachment consisting of Christian exiles and adventurers. As such, in 1220, he became embroiled in a story related to the arrival in Morocco of Berard Carbiosky and four other Franciscan missionaries. After arriving in Marrakech, they began to preach Christianity and blame Islam and the Prophet Muhammad. The 哈里发declared them crazy, and ordered Pedro and his soldiers to expel them from the country. However, the Franciscans managed to escape from Pedro and his soldiers, and continued their actions that were insulting to Muslims in the market square of Marrakesh, as a result of which they were beheaded personally by the caliph.
{PedroI_afPortugal_effects_desc}..

{PedroI_afPortugal2}传记 (2nd part)
{PedroI_afPortugal2_desc}Subsequently, Pedro moved to Aragon, where his mother was born, where he became involved in the intrigues of his relative, the young King Jaime I. In 1229, Pedra, continuing the family tradition of finding brides in Catalonia, married Erumbo, the titular decanter of Urhelsky, exiled from the county by the usurper Hero, who was Jaime's mistress. With the help of Pedro, Jaime began a war with the heirs of Juro, and again subjugated Urhel to the Kingdom of Aragon (for the return of the county, Pedro and Erumbe had to give Jaime the city of Lleida). After the death of Erumba in 1231, Pedro continued to use the title "Count of Urhel", but this was disputed by his overlord Jaime I. \n
   In 1235, Pedra helped the Bishop of Tarragona to recapture the island of Ibiza from Muslims. In 1236, an agreement was reached between Pedro and Jaime: Pedro refused claims on the county of Urhel, which passed to Cabrera’s house and was eventually annexed by Aragon, and in return received the freshly conquered Balearic Islands. \n
   Pedro ruled the Balears until his death in 1258. Since he did not have legal heirs (there were only two illegitimate sons), the islands returned to the Aragonese crown, and the kingdom of Mallorca was formed on them.

{Ferdinand_afPortugal}传记 (1st part)
{Ferdinand_afPortugal_desc}Ferdinand of Portugal (March 24, 1188 - July 27, 1233) - Count of Flanders Gennegau. Ferdinand was the fourth son of 国王Portugal Sanshu I and his wife Dulsa of Aragon. In 1212 he married the Countess of Flanders Jeanne of Constantinople. The ceremony was held in Paris, under the auspices of Philip Augustus. In Peronn, the newlyweds were detained by Philip's son Louis, who demanded that he be given Er-sur-la-Lys, Saint-Omer and even Artois. In turn, the citizens of Ghent closed the gates to the newlyweds, believing that Jeanne was "sold" to Ferdinand Philippe. Finally, a treaty was signed in Pont-a-Verdun, according to which Er and Saint-Omer left Louis in exchange for rejecting claims to Flanders. Only after that the Ghents opened the gates and paid the counts compensation. At that time, elected authorities were established in Ghent. \n
   After this, Ferdinand began to lean toward an alliance with the English king John Landless. In the spring of 1213, Philip delivered a preemptive strike, ravaging Kassel, Ypres and all lands all the way to Bruges. Earl of Salisbury and Renault of Dammarten arrived to help Ferdinand. The British met with the count in Damm, but could not prevent Philip from capturing Lille and Ghent. Ferdinand fled to the island of Valjeren, which belonged to the Holy Roman Empire. After the withdrawal of most of the French troops, he returned Ghent, besieged Tournais and knocked out the French garrison from Lille, but Philip returned, destroyed Lille and captured its inhabitants. Ferdinand fled to England, where he made an alliance with John and Emperor Otton. At the beginning of 1214, Louis besieged Bayol and Stanford, and the returning Ferdinand devastated Artois and Gin and took Saint-Omer and Esden. Soon, Louis went to France to fight with John, who took Poitiers and moved to Angers.

{Ferdinand_afPortugal2_desc}John was defeated at Roche-ex-Muan and retreated. Otto at that time entered Valenciennes, accompanied by two dukes (Henry I of Brabant and Henry III of Limburg) and Count Philip II of Namur, while King Philippe went to Saint-Denis through Saint-Denis. \n
   The decisive battle took place on July 27, 1214 near Buven. Ferdinand certainly wanted to kill Philip, but the champagne battalion blocked his path. The French attacked the right flank of the coalition forces, on which the count fought. He was thrown off his horse, received many wounds and was captured, and his troops fled. The count was transported through France with great disgrace - the peasants who were recently 害怕:him taunted him, saying: “two Ferrands carry a third one” (Ferran’s name was also a horse’s nickname) and “Ferrand en ferre” (Ferrand in iron). Ferdinand was thrown into the dungeons of the Louvre and was released only in 1222. Half of the fifty-thousandth ransom was paid immediately; the cities of Douai, Lille, and Sluis were laid in guarantee of the second half. In addition, Ferdinand took a vassal oath to Blanca of Castile. \n
   Ferdinand remained true to his oath until the end of his life and supported Blanca during the uprising of Pierre Moklerk. In 1228, Ferdinand and Jeanne granted a number of liberties to the cities of Ghent, Ypres, Bruges and Douai. In 1229-1232, Flanders waged a battle with Margarita de Courtenay for the county of Namur, which ended with the Treaty of Cambrai. Ferdinand refused claims in exchange for Golzimer and Old Lille. \n
   Ferdinand died in 1233 in Noyon, from kidney stone disease. His heart is buried in the Noyon Cathedral of Our Lady, and his body is in a monastery in Market de Lille.

To settle the conflict with relatives of his mother from the Sabran clan, he resorted to arbitration by Bermond Le Cornu, Archbishop Aix-en-Provence, and several other lords; as a result, the cities of Forkalkier and Sisteron were awarded to him, as well as the lands between them. Raimund Berenguer IV in December 1220 married Beatrice of Savoy (c. 1205 - 1266), daughter of Count Thomas I of Savoy and Margarita of Geneva. In 1222, Garcenda de Sabran, believing that his son’s power was sufficiently strengthened, transferred the county of Forkalkier to him and went to the Sella Monastery. So the titles of the counts of Provence and Forkalkye again united in the same hands for the first time after 1110, when Adelaide of Provence appropriated the county of Forkalkye. In 1226, Raimund Berenguer IV entered the rebellious Avignon with the crusaders of King Louis VIII.

{RaimundoIV_Berenger2}传记 (2nd part)
{RaimundoIV_Berenger2_desc}However, this brought him little benefit: the name of the pope legates, Cardinal Romain from the Holy Angel, demanded the demolition of city walls and towers and imposed a huge tribute on the city, from which only the Holy See benefited, but not the Count of Provence. The count launched a struggle against the cities of Provence, which became almost independent and controlled by consuls. In 1226, his supremacy was recognized by the consuls of Tarascon, in 1227 - Grasse. In 1229, under the influence of his chief adviser, Roma de Villeneuve, later the Seneschal and the Connaught of Provence, he made a military campaign against Nice, subjugated it and built a new fortress there to keep the city in obedience. \n
   In 1231 he founded the city of Barcelonetta, "little Barcelona", in memory of his Aragonese ancestors. However, the subjugation of all cities was not so simple. Marcel, who again rebelled against the bishop in 1229, called for the help of Count Raimund VII of Toulouse, recognizing him as Viscount of Marseilles. Marceltsev also supported Tarascon in 1231. Later, both counts entered into a truce, but in 1237 Raimund VII again came to the aid of the Marseilles, who stubbornly did not recognize the suzerainty of the Count of Provence. And in 1239, Raimund Berenguer came into conflict with Emperor Frederick II, from whom he kept some lands, supporting his opponent - Pope Innocent IV and expelling from Arles the Viceroy appointed King Frederick de Loretta, for which the emperor declared him an imperial disgrace in December and transferred the lands dependent on him, the county of Forkalkier and Sisteron, to the count of Toulouse.

{RaimundoIV_Berenger3}传记 (3rd part)
{RaimundoIV_Berenger3_desc}In the summer of 1240, Raimund VII invaded Provence, ravaged the Camargue and besieged Arles, where the Marseilles helped him, but the siege dragged on, and in September, Raimund, threatened by Louis IX, was already forced to remove it by his son-in-law Raimund Berenguer . The situation in Arles also remained difficult, where the local archbishop, usually a supporter of the Count of Provence, periodically fought with the patrician, who supported the Count of Toulouse and the emperor; as in many other cities of Provence, at that time local self-government was introduced there, headed by a podesta - on the model of communal cities of Northern Italy. Before his death, the count wrote a will in Sisteron. \n
   The counties of Provence and Forkalkier and all the lands he bequeathed to his youngest daughter Beatrice, still unmarried, for the sake of their integrity; if she dies childless, Jaime of Aragon was appointed heir to the second stage. Margarita and Eleanor got a hundred marks of silver, Sanche - five thousand; the widow's share was also assigned to Beatrice of Savoy. He appointed Archbishop Aix, Bishops of Rieux and Frejus, as well as Roma de Villeneuve, his first minister, as executives. Count Raimund Berenguer IV died on August 19, 1245 and was buried in his capital Aix-en-Provence, in the hospital church of Saint-Jean-de-Malta, next to his father.

Born in the second half of the twelfth century, Jacopo took over as Duke of Crete around 1212.

However, his success was short-lived, as the Venetian fleet soon arrived, forcing him to leave the island. Jacopo was elected Doge on March 6, 1229. When taking office, he was forced to sign a coronation oath, which became a tradition when the Doge took office. Despite the cordial visit of Emperor Frederick II to Venice in 1232, relations between the Empire and the Republic worsened. \n
   In 1239, Venice entered the Lombard League and fought against Ezzelino III da Romano, a powerful ally of the Emperor. Dogat Jacopo Tiepolo brought significant changes to Venice. In 1242, the Doge issued Statutum novum, according to which Venetian civil law was codified in five books of laws. In 1249, Tiepolo abdicated, retired to his home, and died a few months later.

{BohemonddV_dePoitiers}传记 (1st part)
{BohemonddV_dePoitiers_desc}Bohemund V (1199–1252) - Prince of Antioch (1233–1252), Count of Tripoli (March 1233–1252). The second son of Prince Boemund IV the One-Eyed and his first wife, Playsans Embriazo. After the death of his older brother Raymond, the bali of Antioch (killed by the Assassins in 1213), Bohemund V became the heir to the throne of the Principality of Antioch and the county of Tripoli. In 1225, in the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Tartus, he married Alice Champagne, the Dowager Queen of Cyprus. But already in 1227 the marriage was annulled due to the close relationship of the spouses. In the spring of 1233, after the death of Boemund IV the One-Eyed, he inherited the Principality of Antioch-Tripoli. That same summer, he sent the Tripoli knights and mounted sergeants, together with the contingents of the Templars and Hospitallers, to a large-scale raid on Muslim lands in the Bekaa Valley. The prince himself did not participate in the raid, but entrusted the command to his younger brother - Henry. \n
   At the beginning of the reign, following the example of his father, entered into a series of conflicts with the Order of Hospitallers and the Latin Patriarch of Antioch - Albert del Rezzato. Boemund V even allowed himself to capture several close associates and associates of Patriarch Albert, including the marquee of the patriarchal castle Kusair. However, after his marriage to Lucien de Segni, the niece of Pope Innocent III, in 1235 he reconciled with the Latin Church and maintained good relations with the Apostolic See. \n
   The marriage with Lucien de Segni opened the way for an unprecedented influx of Roman nobility to the court of Prince Antioch-Tripoli. For example, the sister of Princess Lucien - Paul de Senyi, for many years occupied the Latin episcopal department in Tripoli; since the prince himself with his court was in Tripoli, Antioch was transferred under the rule of princely bali, also often appointed from among the Roman relatives of Princess Lucien.

{BohemonddV_dePoitiers2}传记 (2nd part)
{BohemonddV_dePoitiers2_desc}Later, the confrontation between the local Syrian barons and the Roman nobility led to open feuds in the Principality of Antioch-Tripoli, which broke out in the reign of the subsequent princes - Boemund VI the Beautiful (1258) and Boemund VII (1275-1282). \n
   In 1236, he personally led the campaign of the Antiochian and Tripoli francs to the north - to help the besieged castle of Bagras (which was under the jurisdiction of the Knights Templar). The timely appearance at the walls of the castle forced the emir of Aleppo to conclude a truce and leave the lands of the Principality of Antioch. \n
   In 1237, together with the master of the Knights Templar Arman de Perigord, he began the invasion of Cilician Armenia. The reason for the war was the repression of King Hetum I against the Templars. Boemund V eagerly joined the campaign and personally led the campaign, driven by a thirst for blood feud; his younger brother Philip, 国王Cilician Armenia, was overthrown and poisoned by the Hetumids in 1225-1226. However, when the Templars entered into a truce with King Hetum I and his father, Konstantin Hetumid, Prince Boemund V was unable to continue the war against Cilician Armenia. Having ravaged several settlements in the east of the Cilician Plain, Boemund V was forced to withdraw his troops beyond the mountains of Amanos. This was the last campaign of the Antiochian francs in Cilicia. \n
   In 1239, he received King Thibault IV of Navarre and other noble crusaders in Tripoli, but himself refrained from actively participating in their campaigns on Palestinian and Galilean lands.
{BohemonddV_dePoitiers2_effects_desc}..

{BohemonddV_dePoitiers3}传记 (3rd part)
{BohemonddV_dePoitiers3_desc}In 1244 he sent troops of the Principality of Antioch-Tripoli to help the kingdom of Jerusalem during the Khorezm invasion and the battle of La Forbi. Bohemund V himself again refrained from personal participation in the campaign, entrusting the Tripoli command to Thomas de Hamm and his cousins ​​Jean and Guillaume de Poitiers (sons of Boemund the Younger, Senor Batrun, uncle Boemund V). During the battle, a significant part of the Antiochian and Tripolian chivalry was killed (thereby sharing the fate of their Palestinian brothers and French crusaders), and the brothers Jean and Guillaume de Poitiers, together with the connective Foma de Ham, were captured by the Saracens. Like his father - Bohemund IV - Prince Boemund V adhered to an extremely tolerant line with regard to the Orthodox church hierarchy on the lands of the Principality of Antioch-Tripoli. In his reign, the Orthodox Patriarch David was given the opportunity to return to Antioch and remain there, along with the Latin Patriarch. This policy of the prince was, in many respects, caused by the desire to enlist the support of the Romance and Melkite population of Antioch, its principality and members of the Antioch commune, who were in their bulk, Greek and Arabic-speaking Orthodox. Tripoli lands and cities also retained significant enclaves and numerous Orthodox communities, which again justified the similar tolerance of the princes of Antioch-Tripoli. \n
   Prince Boemund V's personal passivity (in stark contrast to the style of his father and son) was due to physical trauma. In the Armenian chronicle of King Hetum II, Bohemund V is called "Boemund Lame", which can be regarded as an indication of the injury sustained by the prince and left him a cripple for life.

{Philip_dePoitiers_desc}Philip of Antioch (d. 1226) - Prince of Antioch and 国王the Cilician Armenian kingdom, in which he was co-regent husband of the Armenian queen Zabel. He was the eleventh ruler of Cilicia. \n
   The Prince of Antioch, Philip of Antioch, was one of the youngest children of Boemund IV and the Place de Gilbert. \n
   After the death of the 国王the Cilician Armenian kingdom of Levon, the heiress of the state was the underage princess Zabel. In order to strengthen the state, her regent decided to give Zabel married to Philip. The main condition for marriage was the requirement of the regent Konstantin, on the adoption by the groom of the Armenian religion and respect for the Armenian traditions. Philip agreed, after which in June 1222 in Sis the marriage of Philip of Antioch and Zabel took place. \n
   The newly made husband was recognized as the Prince Consulate of Cilicia. However, Philip did not keep his promise. Touching the national feelings of the Armenians, he neglected the Armenian traditions. At the same time, spending most of his time in Antioch, Philip openly patronized the Latin barons. Philip's actions aroused discontent among both the people and the nobility of the kingdom of Kilia. As a result, after three years, he was imprisoned, where he died.

{RaymondRuben_dePoitiers}传记
{RaymondRuben_dePoitiers_desc}Raimund-Ruben (Raimund Rupen or Raymond-Ruben) (b. 1199 - d. 1221) - ruler of the Principality of Antioch. The son of Count Tripoli Raimund IV and the daughter of the eighth ruler of the Cilician Armenian kingdom Alice. \n
   In 1194, Boemund III was captured by Levon near Bagras, whose release required the special arrival of King Henry of Champagne in Sis of Jerusalem. The condition for release was the rejection of the claims of Boehmund III to Bagras, and the marriage of Alice, daughter of Ruben III, with Raimund IV, the son of Boehmund III. According to the same agreement, a possible heir to this union received the crown of Antioch. In 1199, a son was born to Raimund IV and Alice. \n
   In 1201, Bohemund III died. According to an agreement concluded in 1194 between Cilicia and Antioch, Raimund-Ruben was to ascend the throne. The right to inherit was disputed by the youngest son of the deceased ruler, Boemund IV, who wanted Antioch to join not to Cilicia, but to his possessions. A conflict erupted between the two states. \n
   In 1205, Raimund-Ruben, having overthrown Prince Boemund IV, came to power in Antioch, but three years later, in 1208, he himself was overthrown by Boemund IV. \n
   In 1216, Levon occupied Antioch, authority over which was transferred to the rightful heir, his great-grand nephew Raimund-Ruben. But his reign in Antioch failed and provoked indignation of the population. Moreover, Raimund-Ruben fell out with his grandfather’s brother, the Armenian king. This was probably due to the fact that Levon, who had a second daughter, Zabel, decided to appoint her heir to the Cilician throne. \n
   In 1219, Bohemund IV captured Antioch and expelled Raymond-Ruben.

{Philippp_Ibelin_desc}Philip Ibelin (1180 - 1227) - a nobleman, regent of the Kingdom of Cyprus since 1223 (actually from 1218). Philip Ibelin was the son of the crusader Balian Ibelin and Maria Komnina, the widow of the 国王Jerusalem Amory I. \n
   Philip was first mentioned in documents in 1206 when he, along with his elder brother Jean, accompanied his niece Alice for a wedding with the Cypriot king Hugo I. By 1217, both brothers finally moved to Cyprus - probably due to a conflict with the 国王Jerusalem John. \n
   In 1218, King Hugo I passed away. Since his son Henry was still very small, his mother Alice was appointed regent under him, but it was Philip who became the actual ruler. He used his position to strengthen the influence of the Ibelin house on the island. In 1223, a split occurred between Philip and Alice regarding the attitude to the Orthodox Church. Unable to confront Philip, Alice retired to the mainland in Tripoli, leaving the island in the control of Philip. \n
   In 1225, Philip received information that the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II was preparing for a new crusade and wanted to receive income from the Kingdom of Cyprus. Therefore, he urgently crowned the 8-year-old Henry the 国王Cyprus, and made himself regent under him. His actions were approved by the warring with the emperor, Pope Honorius III. \n
   Philip Ibelin died in 1227, before the emperor arrived in Cyprus and the conflict went into the open phase. After his death, the regent under the infant king was his older brother Jean.

{Baldwin_Ibelin_desc}Baldwin Ibelin (d. February 21, 1267) - statesman and military leader of the era of the Crusades, Seneschal of the Kingdom of Cyprus (since 1246) and, according to some, the Kingdom of Jerusalem. \n
   Balduin Ibelin was born in the family of the influential Jerusalem-Cyprus feudal lord Jean I the Old, one of the most famous representatives of the Ibelin family. Baldwin was the fifth (or fourth) son of Jean Ibelin from his second wife, Melisande, Lady Arsuf. The exact date of birth of Baldwin is unknown, most likely he was born between 1212 and 1215. His place of birth is also unknown, but it can be assumed that it was Beirut, whose senior at that time was his father, or Arsuf, who inherited his mother (in any case, it was the territory of the Levant, because in the politics of the Kingdom of Cyprus Jean Ibelin began to accept participation only since 1217). \n
   After the brother of Jean the Old, Philip Ibelin, in 1218, became the de facto regent of the Kingdom of Cyprus under the young king Henry I of Lusignan and his mother, Queen Alice, Baldwin’s father began to increasingly immerse himself in the intricacies of Cypriot politics. After the death of Philip in 1227, Jean Ibelin becomes regent of the Kingdom of Cyprus. \n
   In the summer of 1228, Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen arrived and the regent of the kingdom, accompanied by his retinue and his two sons, Balian and Baldwin, went to Limassol to greet the emperor. However, Frederick II tricked capturing Jean Ibelin and his sons into captivity and demanded that the regent recognize the emperor’s sovereignty over Cyprus, pay a large sum of money and give him the lord Beirut.
{Baldwin_Ibelin_effects_desc}..

{Baldwin_Ibelin2}传记 (2nd part)
{Baldwin_Ibelin2_desc}After the decisive refusal of Jean Ibelin, the emperor ordered his sons Balian and Balduin to be held hostage in Limassol Castle, “tied to an iron cross, so that they could not bend either their arms or legs, and with them were placed there for the night and other people in chains. ” Soon, their father recognized the power of the emperor Frederick over the kingdom and resigned as regent, after which, obviously, Baldwin and his brother were released. \n
   However, the confrontation between Frederick II and the Ibelins did not stop there. On June 15, 1232, the emperor’s troops were defeated by supporters of Jean Ibelin at the Battle of Agridi, in which the young Baldwin Ibelin also took part. \n
   Further, nothing is known about the fate of Balduin Ibelin until 1246, when King Henry I of Lusignan granted him the position of Seneschal of the Kingdom of Cyprus. In 1247, Baldwin, on behalf of King Henry at the head of a hundred Cypriot knights, participated in the failed defense of Ascalon from the Ayyubid troops besieging the city. In 1249, Baldwin, together with his brother Guy Ibelin, at the head of the Cypriot knights, joined the Seventh Crusade under the leadership of the French King Louis IX. In April 1250, after the defeat of the Crusaders at Fariscur, Balduin Ibelin, together with King Louis IX, was captured by the Egyptians, but was released a month later for ransom. \n
   In one of the documents, dated September 15, 1256, Balduin Ibelin is mentioned as the Seneschal of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

{GenrixxI_Piast}传记 (1st part)
{GenrixxI_Piast_desc}Henry I the Bearded (1163-1238) - Prince of Great Poland (1232-1238) of the period of feudal fragmentation. The son of Boleslav I, Prince of Silesia. Henry was the son of Prince Silesia Boleslav I from his second wife Christina. As the fourth son, he had little chance of inheriting the principality, but the death of his older brothers Boleslav, Konrad and Johann, as well as the fact that his older half-brother Yaroslav was forced to choose a spiritual career, made him the successor of Boleslav. As a result, Henry began to prepare, under the guidance of his father, for participation in political affairs. Thanks to a marriage with Jadwiga of Silesia, Henry was related to the rulers of Germany, Hungary, Bohemia and France. By the time of the death of Boleslav in 1201, Henry was ready for accession to the throne. However, difficulties soon began after this. At the beginning of 1202, his uncle Meshko the Platypod, taking advantage of the death of the nephew of the Opole prince Yaroslav, captured the Opole principality. Thanks to the intervention of the Archbishop of Gnieznenski, Heinrich Ketlitz, and the Bishop of Wroclaw, Cyprian, the conflict was resolved: Meshko refused claims to the lands of Henry, and paid compensation for the Principality of Opole, which Henry had to share with the clergy for support. \n
   In 1210, Pope Innocent III issued a bull with the excommunication of Leszek Bely from the church. This was used by Meshko the Platypod, who captured Krakow and appropriated the title of Grand Duke. The bull was published at the request of the anonymous “prince of Silesia”, which could only be Henry I (Meshko the Platonogee titled himself the prince of Opole-Raciborz). The situation became very confused: no one understood who possessed real power. After Meshko the Platypodius died in 1211, the Gnieznos archbishop Heinrich Ketlitz sent a petition to Rome to remove the interdict from Leszek Bely. Henry I, despite the fact that he was now the eldest of the Piasts, did not aspire to the throne, and Leszek became the Grand Duke.
{GenrixxI_Piast_effects_desc}..

{GenrixxI_Piast2}传记 (2nd part)
{GenrixxI_Piast2_desc}In 1227, Leszek Bely decided to finally solve the problems with the other Piasts, and organized the princely congress in Gonsave. Vladislav III did not come to the congress, it also became known that Svyatopolk II declared independence of Pomerania from Poland. The Grand Duke demanded to take general measures against Svyatopolk, but he struck first: on November 23, 1227, Leszek and Henry were ambushed. Leszek was killed, and Henry was seriously wounded. The struggle for the nationwide throne resumed. \n
   At first, Vladislav III prevailed, but then problems began with Vladislav Odonich, and Vladislav III had to switch to Greater Poland. This allowed Henry to become governor of Krakow on behalf of the Grand Duke. In exchange for the recognition of Henry and his offspring as heirs of the rights to Greater Poland, Henry provided military support to Vladislav III. In 1228, a war broke out between Heinrich and Konrad Mazowiecki. At first, luck was on the side of Henry, but soon he began to have problems with the Krakow nobility. To resolve the conflict, Henry decided in 1229 to meet with Konrad Mazowiecki in Spytkowice; during this meeting he was captured and taken away by the captive in Plock. After this, the troops of Konrad crossed Great Poland and occupied Krakow; Vladislav III fled to Raciborz. Conrad wasn’t only conquered by Silesia, where the son of Henry, Henry II the Pious, took over the regency for the time of his father’s absence and organized the defense. \n
   However, help to Henry I came from an unexpected direction: his wife, Jadwiga, arrived in Plock and persuaded Konrad to let her husband go. Not wanting to spoil relations with European courts, Konrad freed Henry, taking from him a promise to abandon claims to Krakow. Subsequently, the Pope freed Henry from this promise, since it was given under duress.
{GenrixxI_Piast2_effects_desc}..

{GenrixxI_Piast3}传记 (3rd part)
{GenrixxI_Piast3_desc}Conrad had more pressing problems at that time: in the Sandomierz land, which he wanted to transfer to his son Boleslav Mazowiecki, the nobility supported the son of the late Leszek - Boleslav V. Henry I and Vladislav III organized a military expedition to Greater Poland in 1231, but could not take Gniezno. \n
   Suddenly, Vladislav III was killed in Sroda Slaska. Due to the fact that he did not have sons, his claim to Greater Poland was inherited by Henry, however, these claims were immediately challenged. At first, after the death of his cousin Casimir Opołczyk, after whom the young sons Meshko II Opole and Vladislav Opole remained, he decided to take the regency over the Opole principality, which occupied a strategic position on the way to Krakow. However, the Lesser Polish nobility supported Henry, and the widow Leshaek, fearing for the future of her son Boleslav V, transferred him the regency over Sandomierz land. Konrad Mazowiecki did not try to fight the enormous popularity of Henry in Lesser Poland and Sandomierz, and in 1232 Henry entered Krakow, where he was proclaimed Grand Duke. \n
   In an effort to maintain control over Krakow for his offspring, Henry turned to the Holy Roman Emperor to recognize his son Henry as “国王Poland”, but the conflict with the church and the death of Henry on March 19, 1238 did not allow this. The prince of Lower Silesia, Krakow and Greater Poland was his son Henry II the Pious.

  He led the ten thousandth Polish army in the battle of Legnica on April 9, 1241. The Poles were defeated, and he himself was killed by the Mongols. His head was planted on a spear and brought to the gates of the city. \n
  He was the second son, but after the death of his older brother Boleslav became the oldest child in the family. A number of authors believe that in 1213 he participated with his younger brother Conrad in the battle of Studnitsa. The death of Conrad made Henry the only heir to his father. \n

{GenrixxxII_Piast2_desc}After the death of Henry the Bearded, Otton III of Brandenburg and the Archbishop of Magdeburg again tried to capture Lyubush and Santok. But in 1239, their troops were defeated. Henry II was able to resolve, without losing face, the conflict inherited from his father over tax fees with the archbishop of Gnieznenski Pelka and the Wroclaw bishop. Henry II left the traditional union of his family with the Staufen and in the conflict of the emperor and pope supported Gregory IX. This helped resolve his disputes with the Church. Heinrich also patronized the monasteries in Henryk of Luban, Trzebnica, and attracted the Benedictines to Kressov and the Clarissins to Wroclaw. \n
   In 1241, the Mongols invaded Poland during their western campaign “towards the last sea”. Having ravaged the Great and Lesser Poland, they invaded Silesia, where Henry II gathered troops. On April 9, 1241, a bloody battle took place at Legnica. \n
   Most of the Polish troops along with Henry perished. Heinrich's head was planted on a spear and brought to the gate of Legnica. After that, the Mongols went to Hungary. Later, Henry’s corpse was identified by his mother’s leg (she had six fingers on it). He was buried in Wroclaw in a Franciscan monastery. \n
   After the death of Henry II, his power, covering most of Poland, was divided. Not one of the successors was able to unite it again in the near future. Of the five sons of Henry II of Silesia, only Boleslav and his brother Meshko could rule on their own, without needing a regent. But during the first months of the reign, their mother Anna helped them.

{WladyslawwIII_Piast_desc}Vladislav Tonkonogy (1165-1231) - Prince of Silesia and Krakow from 1202 to 1229. Vladislav was the youngest son of Great Poland Prince Meshko III from his second marriage (with Evdokia of Kiev). It was first mentioned in modern sources as a child in 1168. \n
   In 1177–1179, Vladislav, together with his parents, brothers and sisters, was forced to leave the country due to the uprising of Casimir II and Odon of Great Poland. He returned to his homeland only in 1181, but despite the fact that he was an adult legal son, he received no inheritance. The death of Boleslav Kuyavsky in 1193 made Vladislav the sole 继承人Meshko III, and he began to help his father regain dominance over Krakow. \n
   After the death of Meshko III in 1202, his inheritance, Greater Poland, was divided between Vladislav and the infant son of his brother Leszek. At the same time, the inhabitants of Krakow, after a vain attempt to summon Leszka Bely, who did not agree with the conditions, invited Vladislav to the Krakow throne. \n
   In connection with the involvement of Vladislav in Pomeranian affairs, he performs two acts related to them in 1202. First, he meets with Danish King Waldemar II, trying to resolve existing differences and to differentiate spheres of influence. Secondly, he unexpectedly offers the Wroclaw Prince Heinrich Borodatsky Kalisz in exchange for the Lubusz land, the ownership of which facilitated the pursuit of an active policy on the Baltic coast. However, in 1209, Vladislav lost the battle of Lubusz, and Lubusz land was taken from him by the Lugus Margrave Conrad II. However, the problem was that Kalish was part of an inheritance owned by the youngest Vladislav Odonich, and Vladislav Tonkonogy was only a guardian with him.
{WladyslawwIII_Piast_effects_desc}..

{WladyslawwIII_Piast2}传记 (2nd part)
{WladyslawwIII_Piast2_desc}In 1206, Vladislav Odonic, with the support of the archbishop of Gniezno, Heinrich Ketlich, rebelled, but it was quickly crushed by Vladislav Tonkonogy, and the rebels had to flee to Heinrich the Bearded. The excommunication imposed on Vladislav the Thin-Footed Heinrich Ketlich helped little, since the Poznan bishop Arnold II spoke on the side of Vladislav. The reaction of Heinrich Borodaty, however, surprised everyone: he not only accepted the exiles, but also allocated Vladislav Odonich to the reign of Kalisz. Meanwhile, Henryk Ketlich went to Rome with a complaint, and Pope Innocent III ordered the rest of the Polish princes to assist the archbishop of Gniezno in returning his chair. Heinrich Borodaty acted as a mediator, and in 1208 gathered the princes and bishops in Glogow to settle the existing contradictions. However, only Vladislav Tonkonogy was reconciled with Heinrich Ketlich: the archbishop returned to Gniezno in exchange for lifting the anathema. \n
   In subsequent years, the position of the archbishop of Gnieznensky was strengthened more and more, and in 1216 Vladislav Tonkonogy, in order to avoid armed conflict, was forced to nevertheless return to Vladislav Odonich part of his father's possessions. However, the ambitions of the archbishop of Gnieznie scared secular princes, and in 1217 an unexpected agreement was concluded between Vladislav Tonkonogy and Leszek Bely, according to which if one of them died without an heir, then all his possessions would be transferred to another party to the contract. This agreement was clearly aimed against Vladislav Odonich, who was the closest male relative of Vladislav Tonkonogy. Soon, a similar agreement was concluded between Vladislav Tonkonogy and Heinrich Borodaty, and the actual triumvirate of the three Piasts formed, supporting each other. The strength of the triumvirate manifested itself already in 1219, when, after the death of Heinrich Ketlich, they managed to hold their candidate for the post of archbishop of Gniezno.

{WladyslawwIII_Piast3}传记 (3rd part)
{WladyslawwIII_Piast3_desc}However, soon Vladislav Odonich intensified. In 1223 he captured Uysce, and in 1225 - Naklo nad Notecia. 11.11.1227 Leszek Bely, Konrad I of Mazowiecki, Vladislav III Tonkonogy, Vladislav Odonich and Henry I the Bearded gathered for a congress in Gonzava, officially assembled for the reconciliation of Vladislav. Vladislav Odonich, married to the sister of Svyatopolk Pomeransky, convinced that in fact the princes are malicious against the Pomeranian prince. November 14, 1227 Svyatopolk attacked Gonzava. Leshko Bely and Heinrich Borodaty, who were in the bathhouse at the time of the attack, tried to escape. During the flight, Leszek was killed, and Henry was seriously injured. \n
   In response, Vladislav Tonkonogy, with the help of Silesian troops, went on the offensive, captured Vladislav Odonich and claimed his rights to the title of Grand Duke on the basis of an agreement with the late Leszek Bely. Another contender for the princely throne was Konrad Mazowiecki. On May 5, 1228, a congress was held in Wislice, at which the Polish nobility elected the Grand Duke Vladislav Tonkonogy; True, Vladislav had to recognize Boleslav as his main heir to the deceased son of the late Leshaek. Vladislav Odonich soon managed to escape to Plock and resumed the war. Conrad of Mazowiecki acted as an ally of Odonich, but he was hit by Henry II the Pious, the son of Heinrich Borodaty, whom Vladislav made the governor of Krakow. The following year, Konrad Mazowiecki renewed the war and managed to capture Heinrich Borodaty, after which he and Odonich launched open hostilities against Vladislav. The defeated Vladislav was forced to flee to Raciborz in 1229 to the court of Casimir Opole. In 1231, Vladislav Tonkonogy, with the support of Heinrich Borodaty, moved again to Vladislav Odonich, but was unexpectedly killed in Sroda Slaska.

{Wladyslawww_Piast}传记 (1st part)
{Wladyslawww_Piast_desc}Vladislav Odonich (1190 - 1239) - Prince of Kalisz 1207-1217, Prince of inheritance on the Obre River 1216-1217, Prince of Great Poland 1229-1239, Prince of Gdansk 1229-1239, Prince of Kalisz 1229-1234, prince of inheritance on the river Obre 1229-1234. Vladislav was the eldest son of Greater Poland Prince Odon and Princess Vysheslav Galitskaya. \n
   In 1194, Vladislav's father died, who also owned an inheritance on the Obre River. Kalish took away Bag III Old. The juvenile Vladislav received an inheritance on the Obre River, his uncle Vladislav III Thin-footed became the guardian under him. Having reached adulthood, Vladislav Odonich in 1206, demanded from his uncle his father's legacy, which he appropriated to himself during his nephew's childhood. Odonich strengthened his demands when Vladislav III the Thin-Footed lost to Heinrich Borodatom Kalish in exchange for Lyubush. \n
   In July 1210, Archbishop Heinrich Ketlich convened a congress of bishops and princes in Borzykovo to discuss the current situation and the bull of Pope Innocent III, in which Henry I the Bearded, rather than Meshko Krivonogii, was named the oldest among the Piasts. At the same time, a coalition of the church and the young princes (Vladislav Odonich, Leszek Bely, Konrad Mazowiecki) against Vladislav Tonkonogy and Meshko Krivonogogo was created. The coalition also decided to support the archbishop with his demands to renounce the princely right to appoint bishops and other benefits for the church. In 1216, Archbishop Ketlich supported by the pope and thanks to the support of other Polish princes managed to force Vladislav Tonkonogy to allocate his father’s inheritance to his nephew. Odonic received an inheritance on the Obre River. The treaty drawn up in Dankovo, and soon the death of Archbishop Ketlich, led to the fact that Vladislav III Tonkonogy ceased to reckon with his nephew altogether and in 1217 attacked his possessions. Odonic fled (since none of the princes Piast accepted him) to Hungary.
{Wladyslawww_Piast_effects_desc}..

{Wladyslawww_Piast2}传记 (2nd part)
{Wladyslawww_Piast2_desc}In the end, Vladislav went to Gdansk Pomerania to the prince of Svyatopolk of Gdansk, who sought to free himself from the power of the Krakow prince Leszek Bely and promised Odonich help. To strengthen the union, Vladislav had to marry Jadwig. Her origin is not known - there are hypotheses that she could be the sister of Svyatopolk or the sister of the wife of Svyatopolk. \n
  Svyatopolk II Pomeransky provided assistance to Odonic already in 1223, when he managed to cunningly take control of the city in the north-eastern part of Great Poland Uysze. Two years later, Odonich fighting off uncle's armed attacks managed to seize the city of Naklo as well. In 1227, Vladislav III Thin-Footed finally decided to deal with his nephew. For this purpose, he sent a strong army led by the governor Dobrogost, who besieged Uysce. Not only did they not succeed in capturing the strongly fortified city, but on July 15, Vladislav Odonich, using surprise, hit the army of Dobrogost and defeated his troops. The governor himself died. Thanks to this victory, Odonic seized the initiative and took possession of most of the cities of Great Poland. \n
  The danger of finally losing their possessions persuaded Vladislav Tonkonogy to start negotiations to resolve the conflict. For these purposes, a solemn congress of princes and clergymen was convened in November 1227 in Gonsave. At the congress, in addition to the conflict of both Vladislavs, the issue of seizing the possessions of Greater Poland by Svyatopolk Pomeranian (who took advantage of the unrest in Greater Poland captured Naklo) was discussed. But the congress ended tragically. On November 24, the Princes of the Congress were attacked by the Pomors, who managed to kill the Krakow prince and seriously injure the Silesian. The main culprit of the atrocity is Svyatopolk Pomorsky, although there is an assumption that Odonic also participated in the crime.
{Wladyslawww_Piast2_effects_desc}..

{Wladyslawww_Piast3}传记 (3rd part)
{Wladyslawww_Piast3_desc}At the beginning of 1228, Vladislav III Tonkonogy, taking advantage of Silesian help, captured Odonic. The prince of Great Poland did not succeed in taking advantage of it, since Vladislav Odonich fled to Plotsk to Konrad Mazowiecki. \n
  In 1229, Odonic, united with Konrad, attacked Vladislav Tonkonogy. Vladislav Odonic without much effort managed to capture most of Great Poland. Conrad Mazowiecki was much less successful, whose troops besieged Kalis to no avail. Vladislav III Thin-footed seeing that the war was lost fled in 1229 to Silesia. The success of Vladislav Odonich was complete, although there was still a threat, what the new Great Poland prince had the chance to see when in the spring of 1231 an uncle at the head of the Silesian troops reached Gniezno. \n
  On November 3, 1231, Vladislav III the Thin-footed died, before his death he managed to transfer his rights to Greater Poland to the Prince of Silesia, Heinrich Bearded. \n
  After the conclusion of peace, Vladislav Odonich, Henry II the Pious and Konrad Mazowiecki went on a crusade against the pagan Prussians. \n
  In 1234, a conflict arose unexpectedly between the Silesian prince and the prince of Great Poland Vladislav Odonic. Henry I the Bearded was well prepared for this war, who without much effort captured the southern part of Great Poland, threatening at the same time to capture the rest. \n
  The death on March 19, 1238 of Heinrich Borodaty did not lead to the example of Vladislav with the Silesian princes, since Henry II the Pious, the son of Heinrich Borodaty, considered Great Poland his. In 1239 the war began again, once again Odonic was defeated and lost the rest of his possessions in Greater Poland, with the exception of Naklo and Uysce.

{ZemovitI_Piast}传记 (1st part)
{ZemovitI_Piast_desc}Zemovit I of Mazovia (1215-1262) - Prince Chersky (1247-1262), Plotsky (1248-1262), Mazovia (1248-1262) and Sieradz (1259-1260), the youngest son of Prince of Mazovia Konrad I and the Russian Princess Agafia Svyatoslavovna Severskaya. One of the Polish princes of the period of feudal fragmentation. \n
  In 1239, on the orders of his father, Zemovit killed the Plotcan canon Jan Heron, who was his tutor in childhood. Ian showed his negative attitude to the marriage of his older brother Casimir, and also, probably, was unflattering about Conrad’s rule. Zemovit first threw Jan into prison, and then hanged. It is believed that the cause of the murder was Konrad’s financial conflict with the ruling circles of Plock. \n
  In 1247, after the death of his father, the Prince of Mazovia, Konrad, Zemovit, according to his will, was to receive three possessions - Sieradz, Lenchitsa and Chersk. However, taking advantage of the confusion that began after Konrad’s death, most of these territories were captured by Zemovit’s elder brother Casimir. Zemovit was able to save part of Mazovia with the capital in Chersk only with the military support of another brother, Boleslav. \n
  In the spring of 1248, the childless Boleslav died unexpectedly, and according to his will Zemovit Chersky received the rest of Mazovia, along with Plock, Visnaya and Liv. After this, for some time he avoided open conflicts with his brother Casimir, concentrating on the situation on the borders with Russia, the Yatvages and the Teutonic Order. \n
  One of his main problems was the destructive raids on his territory of the Baltic tribes. In the fall of 1248, Zemovit, together with the Krakow prince Boleslav Shameful, the princes of Galician Daniil Romanovich and Volyn Vasilko Romanovich, with whom he entered into an alliance, carried out a successful military campaign against the Yatvyag. This victory made it possible to remove the threat from the Yatvyaz raids for several years.

{ZemovitI_Piast2_desc}Soon, to strengthen the union, Zemovit married the daughter of Daniel Pereyaslav. \n
   In 1253 and 1255, Zemovit Mazowiecki, together with the Allies, undertook two more military campaigns against the Yatvyag. However, Zemovit and Daniel realized that their strength was not enough to completely protect themselves from this tribe. \n
   In 1254, in Racionzha, Zemovit Mazowiecki and Daniil entered into an agreement with the Teutonic Knights Crusaders on the division of the Yatvyaz land between Mazovia, Galicia and the Teutonic Order. In December 1254, when Zemovit and his wife Pereyaslav returned from Krakow to celebrate the canonization of St. Stanislav Schepanovsky, the people of Casimir captured them and imprisoned them in the castle of Sieradz. \n
   Zemovit and Pereyaslav were released the following year after the intervention of Polish King Boleslav V Shy and a number of other rulers, in exchange for a promise to support Casimir in the war against Svyatopolk II Pomeransky. In late spring 1262, troops of Lithuanians and Russians unexpectedly invaded the lands of Zemovit under the command of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Mindovg. The suddenness of the blow allowed them to practically meet no resistance, burn Plock, cross the Vistula and besiege the Uyazdov fortress, where Zemovit was with his eldest son Konrad. They could withstand the siege and wait for the allies to come, but traitors from among the townspeople let in enemy troops. In the ensuing turmoil of the battle, Zemovit was killed. There is also a version that he was executed by order of his brother-in-law Shvarn Danilovich.

   Came from the same place in today's area of ​​the Rhineland-Palatinate Eifel-Bitburg-Prüm. Most likely joined the Teutonic Order in 1217 in Acre. By this time, some of his relatives were already among the Templars. In 1227, Gerhard became the commander of one of the most important Palestinian castles of the order - Thoron Castle. Gerhard’s position in Palestine and family ties in the Templar Order allowed him to be in opposition to the Grand Master German von Salz during his stay in the retinue of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, who was in the Holy Land in 1228-1229. \n
   The main reason for the disagreement was the determination of the direction of further development of the order. Gerhard was one of the strongest representatives of the "Palestinian faction", which defended the need to strengthen the Palestinian direction. While the Grand Master defended the northeastern direction (in Prussia). But only with the death of Hermann von Salz and his “heir” according to the political views of Konrad of Thuringian Gerhard managed to take the post of Grand Master. However, after 4 years he had to leave this post due to the growing dissatisfaction of the order. After his resignation, little is known about him.

The exact date of his entry into the order is unknown, but in 1215 he was already in Acre among the brothers of the order. He was a close friend of the great masters Hermann von Salz and Heinrich von Hohenlohe, which allowed him to take part in various secret diplomatic missions of the order. In 1244-1246, he was with the great master Heinrich von Hohenlohe in Prussia. In 1249, he was elected Grand Master of the Order at the General Chapter in Acre. As a great master, he apparently did not leave the borders of Palestine. \n

{Hermann_vonBalk}传记 (1st part)
{Hermann_vonBalk_desc}Hermann von Balk - Landmaster of the Teutonic Order in Germany (1219–1230), first (in chronology) Landmaster of the Order in Prussia (1229–1239) and at the same time Landmaster in Livonia (1237–1238). He made a significant contribution to the conquest of the Prussians by the Order in the 13th century. He founded a large number of castles and cities. \n
   In 1226, according to the Golden Bull of Emperor Frederick II, the Teutonic Order received in its possession lands lying to the north of the Vistula as part of imperial possessions. As the Landmaster of the Teutonic Order on lands not yet conquered, Hermann von Balk begins to conquer the Prussian tribes. In 1230, the Order concludes an agreement with the Prince of Mazovia, Konrad I, on the transfer to him of Kulma land for the defense of Polish lands from Prussian raids. \n
   To a large extent, the conclusion of this contract depended directly on Hermann Balk - the chief order leader in this territory. After the heavy defeat of the Order of the Sword-Bearers at the Battle of Saul (Šiauliai, Lithuania) in 1237, with his participation, the remnants of this order, located on the territory of Livoniis with the Teutonic Order, were merged.

{Hermann_vonBalk2}传记 (2nd part)
{Hermann_vonBalk2_desc}Hermann von Balk founded the castles of Marienverder, Kulm, Elbing, Thorn, Balga and others, around which the first Prussian cities arose over time, which favored the influx of new German colonists to these lands. Through some modification of the Magdeburg and Lubeck city law, the so-called Kulm city law was developed. The Kulm rules developed by him and the great master of the order Hermann von Salz in 1233 served as the basis for the emergence of all subsequent cities in Prussia. The first to exercise this right were the settlements of Kulm and Thorn. \n
   After taking over the landmaster of Livonia, Hermann von Balk had a tense relationship with the Bishop of Riga. This, as well as his illness made it necessary for him to leave for Germany, where he died in Würzburg. The activities of Hermann von Balk, as well as the activities of the great master Hermann von Salz, lay at the basis of the formation of the state of the Teutonic Order in Prussia.

{Andreas_vonFelfen}传记 (1st part)
{Andreas_vonFelfen_desc}Andreas von Velfen (born in Styria, Austria) - vice-landmaster of the Livonian department of the Teutonic Order (1240-1241, 1248-1253). According to Balthazar Russov, before taking on the post of Livonian landmaster Andreas von Velfen was a commander (commander) of Riga. Known for the fact that he commanded the Livonian knights in 1242, during the famous “Battle of the Ice”, he didn’t fight, having entrusted the command to the Comturas, he preferred to be at a safe distance, and therefore was not captured. In 1241, an Estonian uprising took place on the island of Ezel (Saaremaa). The Ezelians abandoned Christianity and began to exterminate the Germans. The Ezelian Bishop Heinrich barely escaped death. The Livonian master Andreas von Velfen suppressed the Ezel rebellion, forcing the locals to return to Christianity and recognize the authority of the Order. \n
   The fact that Andreas von Velfen concluded an agreement with the Saaremaa (Ezel) bishop on the division of secular and spiritual power in the conquered Russian lands on behalf of the Order also confirms his leading role in conducting the Livonian Crusade to Russia. In the life of Alexander Nevsky appears under the name "Andreiash." His trip to Russia is also described there, which historians have neither proved nor disproved. \n
   In 1248, Andreas von Velfen re-became the Landmaster of the Teutonic Order in Livonia. He pursued an aggressive policy, trying to subordinate the supreme power of the Order of the Zemgals, Zhmudins and Lithuanians. He entered into a military alliance with Prince Daniil Romanovich Galitsky, directed against the Grand Duke of Lithuania Mindovg. At the court of the Galician prince, the princes Vikint, Tovtivil and Erdivil, relatives and opponents of Mindovg, who captured their inheritance, took refuge. Daniel sent the Zhmud prince Vykint, uncle of Mindovg, with rich gifts to the Yatvig, Zhmudin and Livonian knights.
{Andreas_vonFelfen_effects_desc}..

{Andreas_vonFelfen2}传记 (2nd part)
{Andreas_vonFelfen2_desc}The Yotvägi and some Zhmudins agreed to oppose Mindovg. The Livonian crusaders sent to tell the Galician prince Daniil: “We have reconciled with you for Wikint, even though he has destroyed a lot of our brothers” - and pledged to provide him with military assistance in the war against Lithuania. In 1250, the Galician-Volyn princes made a large military campaign against Lithuania, where they took and devastated the cities of Volkovysk, Slonim and Zditov. However, the Livonian crusaders did not provide the promised help. Prince Tovtivil (Mindovg’s nephew) went to Riga, where he received Catholic baptism under the name of Gottlieb. After that, the Livonian master Andreas von Velfen began to prepare for the war against Lithuania. But the Grand Duke of Lithuania Mindovg was able to upset the enemy coalition. \n
   At the beginning of 1251, Mindovg entered into negotiations with the Livonian magistrate Andreas von Velfen. At a personal meeting with the master, Mindovg promised to receive Catholic baptism, and in return asked for the royal title from the pope. Mindovg ceded to the Livonian Order of the land of the northern Baltic tribes (villages, Kurshi and Zemgals). The Livonian master and the bishop of Riga informed Pope Innocent of negotiations, having received full approval from him. The Pope instructed the Livonian magister to organize the coronation of Mindovg. In 1251, the Grand Duke of Lithuania Mindovg, together with his wife and many subjects, received Catholic baptism, and in the summer of 1253 he was crowned bishop Henry of Kulm. At the coronation was attended by the Livonian master Andreas von Velfen. In exchange for his coronation, Mindovg agreed to cede part of the Yatvyaz and Zemait lands to the crusaders. In the same 1253, Andreas von Velfen resigned and left for Germany.

   Heinrich von Weide joined the Order in 1224. Since 1239 he was in Prussia as a landmaster. \n
   In 1242, the city council of the city of Lubeck turned to the Teutonic Order with a proposal to build a free city at the mouth of the Pregel in exchange for allocating funds to the Order to fight the Prussians. On December 31, 1242, Heinrich von Wade entered into an agreement with Lübeck on these conditions, but at the same time there was an uprising of the Prussians and the execution of the contract was postponed. In March 1246, two plenipotentiaries (Shtureman and Tankuard) arrived from Lubeck to Prussia, who were instructed to fulfill the obligations of the contract. The new landmaster of Prussia Poppo von Ostern refused to fulfill the agreement (as external conditions changed, the uprising was crushed and the order gained great strength on these lands).
{Heinrichh_von_Veida_effects_desc}..

{Heinrichh_von_Veida2}传记 (2nd part)
{Heinrichh_von_Veida2_desc}To resolve the dispute, the parties turned to a third party, Bishop Heidenreich of Kulm, who delivered his verdict on March 10, 1246: “Lubeck is free to build a city at the mouth of Pregel, but this city will obey the order and have limited privileges. The fortress, no doubt, should be under the jurisdiction of the Teutonic Order. The order must also have military and political dominion over the city. ” However, the city was never founded in 1246, and entry into the Hansa took place only in 1339. \n
   In 1247, after Svyatopolk (the Pomeranian prince) built a fortress near Christburg during his campaign against the order, Heinrich von Wade was appointed vice-landmaster of Prussia and “came with 50 knights and many other soldiers to Prussia, located not far from "the Prussian fortress Pomeran and on Christmas night took the fortress, after which it began to be called Christburg."

The son of the sevastocrat Manuel, the grandson of the Byzantine emperor Andronic I. After the death of his grandfather and father as a result of a political coup in Constantinople in 1185, the young Alex and his brother David were secretly taken to Georgia to their aunt, Queen Tamara.
   After the capture of Constantinople by the crusaders in 1204, the exiles had the opportunity to try to regain imperial power. With military support from Georgia, Alexey and David asserted their authority in several cities on the southern Black Sea coast, and shortly afterwards, 22-year-old Aleksey was proclaimed emperor. \n
   Alex and David began their campaign on Trebizond even before the news of the looting of Constantinople on April 13, 1204. Their initial intention was not to create a bridgehead for the restoration of the Byzantine Empire, but to "cut off" the buffer territory from the Byzantine Empire to protect Georgia from the Seljuk Turks.
   Alex was originally going to overthrow the dynasty of Angels. However, soon after the brothers gained control of Trebizond, news of the fall of Constantinople came, and the Comnins had to switch to rivalry with the Nicene Emperor Theodore Laskaris and the Epirus despot Mikhail Komnin for leadership among the rulers of the former imperial lands.

Alex also joined part of the Crimea with Khersones and Kerch. Contemporaries might suggest that the return of the Komnins to the Byzantine throne is only a matter of time. \n
   However, after several defeats of the Trebizondians from the troops of the Nicene emperor Theodore Laskaris and the Seljuks, Alexei had to abandon his claims to the all-Byzantine throne. Nothing definite about the future life of Alexei is unknown. He died at the age of forty on February 1, 1222 after an 18-year reign.

Andronik married the daughter of Alexei I, whose name is unknown. Andronic Guide was "very visionary and versed in military affairs." His experience in the war seriously helped the newborn empire in a clash with the Seljuks and Khorezmshahs in 1224. In the war against the Iconic Sultan Melik, the Andronic Guide was able to defeat the Turkish army that besieged his capital and capture the Sultan himself. \n
   In violation of the treaty between the Turks and Trebizond of 1220, the governor of the city, Hetum, seized precious cargo, passengers and crew, and also sent a fleet to plunder Peratheya. In response, Andronicus gathered the fleet and directed it against Sinop. His people attacked the city and captured the crews of ships standing in the harbor. They freed Crimean captives and took away the money captured by the Turks.
   Upon learning of the attack, Sultan Kay-Kubad I moved to Trebizond. In response to the threat from the Sultan, Andronicus gathered all his soldiers and strengthened the passes leading to the city. The emperor inflicted significant damage to the vanguard of the sultan, but was able to prevent him from starting a siege of the city.
   The Sultan set up a camp near the monastery of St. Eugene and set fire to the suburbs. The last night assault on the city failed due to a sudden thunderstorm with heavy rain and hail. The Turks faltered and abandoned the camp, even leaving their sultan.

A peace treaty advantageous for Trebizond was concluded, according to which the Trebizond empire became independent from the Turks. The Sultan was reportedly so impressed with the moderate conditions of the world that he subsequently sent Arabian horses a gift to Andronicus annually and donated money to the monastery of St. Eugene. \n
   At this time, the troops of the Khorezmshah Jalal ad-Din entered the territory of Anatolia, and the emperor Andronic decided to conclude an alliance with Khorezm against the Seljuk Sultan. This alliance was unsuccessful. The troops of Khorezm, among which there was a detachment of trapezunts, were defeated by the Turks at the battle of Akhlat around 1230. The Andronic Guide paid for participation in the war against the Sultanate, and again was forced to pay tribute to the Seljuks, as well as send his troops to help the Sultan. \n
   A few years later, in 1235, the Andronic Guide died. He was succeeded by the son of Alexei I - John Aksuh the Great Komnin.

{Feodorrr_KomninDuka_desc}Theodore Comnenus Duca (c. 1180-1253) - often incorrectly referred to as Theodore Angel or Theodore Angel Comnenus Duca. The ruler of the kingdom of Epirus and Thessaly in 1215-1230, as well as the Thessalonian emperor from 1224 to 1230. After Theodore was released from Bulgarian captivity, he became the ruler of Southern Macedonia with the capital Woden in 1237-1251. \n
   Theodore was born in 1180/1185 and was the legitimate son of Sebastocrat John Duca. He was the half-brother of Mikhail I Komnin Duki - the founder of the Epirus kingdom, great-grandson of Alexei I Komnin, and was a cousin of two emperors at once: Isaac II and Alexei III. Thus, in his veins the blood of three noble Byzantine families immediately flowed: Angels, Duk and Komninov. Like his predecessor, Michael I Komnin Duca, Theodore preferred to use the name "Duca" or "Comnenus Duca." \n
   In 1230, Theodore Comnenus Duca opened hostilities against the Bulgarian kingdom. With his attack, Theodore Komnin flagrantly violated the peace treaty concluded between the two states. Upon learning of the invasion, Ivan Asen II quickly gathered a small army and moved to the enemy. The battle of Klokotnitsa took place, in which Theodore Komnin suffered a crushing defeat. Emperor Thessaloniki himself was captured and sent to Tarnovo. There he was blinded, suspecting a conspiracy against the Bulgarian king. Thus, the forces of Epirus were forever thrown back from the capital of the Latin Empire. In a short time, almost all of Thrace and southern Macedonia fell into the power of the Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Asen II. Nevertheless, getting rid of the threat in the person of Theodore, the Latins refused the regency to the Bulgarian king. As a result of this, Ivan Asen II concluded a peace treaty with the Nicene Empire.

He was sent to his own son, so that he agreed to take the title of despot and become a vassal of Nicaea, Theodore was allowed to stay in southern Macedonia. In 1246, Vatats took Thessaloniki from the youngest son of Duka, Demetrius. \n
   In 1251, under the pressure of Theodore, the despot of Epirus Michael II the Comnenus of Duc, tried to capture Thessaloniki. The attack on Thessaloniki failed, and Michal II the Comnenus of Duc was forced to come to peace. Theodore Comnenus of Duc was sent into exile in Asia Minor, where he died in 1253.

Manuel was the son of the Sevastocrat John Duci and cousin of the Byzantine emperors Isaac II and Alexei III, and his brothers Michael (illegitimate) and Theodore were the rulers of the kingdom of Epirus. In the period between 1225-1227, Manuel received the title of despot from Theodore, and at the same time married Mary (the illegitimate daughter of Ivan II Asen), which strengthened the union of Epirus and Bulgaria. \n
   After the battle of Klokotnitsa, Theodore and his family fell into Bulgarian captivity, Manuel became the new emperor in Thessaloniki. Manuel also owned Epirus, which he gave to his nephew Mikhail II Comnenus Duc. By that time, all Thrace and Macedonia, Northern Thessaly, Great Vlachia and Epirus Dirrachius were transferred to Bulgaria. Manuel made an alliance with both the Achaean prince Geoffroy Villardouin and the 国王Serbia Stephen. \n
   Nobody threatened the authorities of Manuel until 1237, when his father-in-law Ivan Asen married the daughter of Theodore Irina. After this, he released his new kin, and the Comnenas of Duci arrived in Thessaloniki. Soon, Manuel was overthrown, and he was sent to the Asia Minor city of Adalia. Muslims allowed him to go to Nicaea. Having received money and a fleet from John III of Duca Vatac, Manuel returned to Greece in 1239, where he captured the cities of Larisa, Farsala and several fortresses, becoming the ruler of Thessaly.

Upon learning of this, Michael returned to Epirus. The new emperor Thessaloniki Manuel Comnenus of Duca transferred Epirus to Michael II and granted him the title of despot. However, Manuel's suzerainty was conditional, and very soon Michael II acted as an independent ruler, issuing charters and concluding treaties on his behalf. Michael strengthened the support of local elites by marrying Theodore Petralife, the daughter of the influential sevastocrat Petralifa. In 1241, Manuel Comnenus Duca died bequeathing to Thessaly to Michael II. \n
  In 1238, the sovereign was visited by Patriarch Herman II of Constantinople, and in 1249 he received the title of despot from the Nicene Emperor John III of Duca Vatac.

John was the eldest son of the ruler of Epirus Theodore Comnenus Ducas and Mary Petralifa. In 1230, the father and his family were captured in the battle of Klokotnitsa by the soldiers of the Bulgarian Tsar Ivan II Asen. When in 1237, the daughter of Komnin Duki Irina became the wife of Asen, John was released along with his blinded father and younger brother Dmitry. They reached Thessaloniki and overthrew the brother of Theodore Manuel, who seized power in the city in 1230. After that, John became the ruler of Thessalonica, whom Father Theodore proclaimed emperor, and he went to Edessa. \n
   In 1239, Manuel returned with the troops of the Nicene Empire, and with their help established himself in Thessaly. Thus, the Thessalonian Empire of John was only a city with a surrounding area. The empire kingdom was in the hands of Michael II, and was virtually independent. Thessaly is in the hands of Maniul. In 1241, the patron saint of Thessalon Emperor Ivan II Asen died, after which the ruler of Nicaea John III Duca Vatats decided on a more active policy in this region. In 1241, he deceived the father of John Theodore by deception, and led the army to capture Thessaloniki. John repelled this attack, and at that time came the news that the Seljuks had attacked the eastern possessions of Vatats. The rulers in 1242 entered into an agreement under which Komnin recognized the power of the Asia Minor sovereign, renounced the imperial title, and in exchange received the title of despot Thessaloniki. John died in 1244, and Thessaloniki came under the rule of his younger brother Demetrius.

   Theodore was the son of Emperor John III. Having taken power, Theodore immediately began a war against the Bulgarians. The war was stubborn, and, under conditions of peace, the borders of both states remained largely unchanged, although the Romans got back Thrace. By nature, the emperor was ardent in all respects and for his dignitaries he was a sovereign ruler heavy and strict. He did not have the hardness of his father, but was distinguished in all speed and generosity. Theodore was a learned man; he knew how to express his thoughts well and eloquently. \n
   Soon after the accession to the throne of Byzantium, he fell into a serious illness, so that he often fell to the floor during an attack. Rumor had it that the emperor was allegedly bewitched by sorcerers. Therefore, the Romance officials of Theodore many people, even noble, were seized and imprisoned with him, as soon as there was a suspicion that they were engaged in witchcraft. Shortly before his death, Theodore, exhausted by an ailment, turned, according to the Acropolis, into a perfect skeleton. \n

{MikhailVIII_Palaiologos_desc}Michael VIII Palaeologist (c. 1224 - December 11, 1282), Byzantine emperor, founder of the Paleologists dynasty; reigned from 1261 (from 1258 as the Nicene emperor). The founder of the last imperial dynasty of Byzantium, Mikhail Paleolog began his journey to the throne as regent with the young heir to the Nicene emperor Theodore II Laskaris (1254-58) John IV. Soon he was crowned co-ruler and usurped power from the last Laskarid, who was blinded and imprisoned. \n
   Michael's domestic policy boiled down to a reaction to the actions carried out by the Laskarids. A protege of a large land aristocracy, he made hereditary pronity and thereby sharply weakened the centralizing function of the state. Money distributions to the service class were increased, as a result of which taxes increased, with the collection of which Michael canceled the benefits of military acre settlers on the eastern border of Nicaea.

{MikhailVIII_Palaiologos2_desc}July 25, 1261 Constantinople was taken by the Nicene forces, and three weeks later, on August 15, Michael VIII entered the capital of the restored Byzantine Empire and was re-crowned by the emperor in St. Sophia Cathedral. This entailed significant changes in the geopolitical situation in the Eastern Mediterranean. Like his predecessors, Michael VIII was forced to confirm the privileges of the mighty Venice, but tried to weaken its superiority by granting the same privileges to Genoa. His main opponent in the West was Karl of Anjou, under whose authority the Sicilian kingdom and southern Italy passed. Karl, sparing no strength, put together alliances against Byzantium, threatening her with war. \n
   The diplomatic skills of Michael VIII culminated in the signing of the Union of Lyons in 1274 with the pope, which was to play the role of a political treaty and prevent a new crusade in order to recreate the Latin Empire. Michael achieved his goals, the pope himself forbade Karl to attack the Byzantine state. In 1282, the “Sicilian Vespers” finally broke the power of Charles, and Michael could triumph. However, the union created new problems, causing powerful opposition to the emperor among his subjects. The Liberator of Constantinople became hated for his betrayal of Orthodoxy, his death went unnoticed. By the end of the life of the first Paleologist on the throne of Constantinople, the external position of the empire was relatively favorable, but internal affairs had noticeably worsened.

   In 1246, Manuel personally visited the headquarters of the son of Ogedey, the great khan Guyuk. The emperor's rightful political choice was soon rewarded. According to the historian Shukurov, Manuil received a label from the Mongol Khan on the reign of Trebizond and Sinop. On June 24, 1254, Manuel conquered Sinop from the Seljuks. \n
   In 1253, Manuel sent ambassadors to the 国王France, Louis IX, who was at that time in Sidon, after losing at the battle of Fariscur, hoping to be related to him - Manuel was widowed not long before. “The king did not take any of his daughters to the crusade,” writes historian William Miller, “therefore, he recommended that Manuel make a proposal for the marriage of the Latin Empire, which would be useful for both states in the fight against Vatats, the Greek emperor Nicaea.” The sources are silent about the further history of Manuel’s matchmaking, but it is known that in the end, the daughter of the Trebizond noble Irina Sirikaina became his third wife.

   In 1187, al-Afdal stood at the head of his father's forces against the Crusaders Gerard de Ridfort, the Grand Master of the Templars, at the Battle of Cresson. Al-Afdal's troops totaled about 7,000 fighters. Gerard suddenly attacked the army of al-Afdahl on May 1, in the ensuing battle, the Muslims feignedly retreated. This was their usual tactic, which Gerard was not supposed to fool. However, the Templar leader ordered the persecution of Muslims, contrary to the advice of the Grand Master of the Order of Hospitallers Roger de Moulins, and the knights lagged behind the foot soldiers. Muslims easily repelled the attack of the knights, exhausted by the persecution, and then defeated the foot soldiers. Gerard survived, but almost everyone else was killed. \n

In 1196, al-Aziz, in alliance with al-Zahir, invaded Damascus. Al-Afdal was exiled to Salhad. There is no evidence of his death, but it is believed that he died in exile in 1225.

In 1232, al-Salih was taken over by Hasankeyf in Jazir (now part of Turkey), captured from the Artukids. In 1234, al-Kamil sent him to rule Damascus, removing him from succession because of suspicions that al-Salih, with the help of the Mamluks, plotted against him. His uncle, al-Salih Ismail ibn-Ahmad, soon expelled him from Damascus, and al-Salih fled to Jazira, where he teamed up with the Khorezm people. \n
   In 1238, al-Kamil died, leaving al-Salih his heir in Jazir, and his other son, al-Adil II, ruler of Egypt. In subsequent dynastic disputes, al-Salih took control of Damascus in 1239 and began to use it as a springboard for expanding his possessions. He received the support of the old emirs of his father in Egypt, who turned to him to get rid of al-Adil. At the beginning of 1240, when al-Salih was preparing to invade Egypt, he was informed that his brother was captured by his own soldiers. As-Salih was invited to Cairo for accession to the throne.

   Aibek came from the Turkmens, in any case, among the Mamluks, he was known as Aibek at-Turkmani. At the court of the ayyubid sultan al-Salih Ayyub, he earned himself emirs and received the post of jashnkir ("tasting the food and drinks of the sultan"). After the death of al-Salih Ayyub (1249) during the Franks invasion (Seventh Crusade) and the tragic death of his son and heir Turan Shah (May 1250), Shadjar ad-Durr, the widow of al-Salih Ayyub, captured her deceased husband with the help of the Mamelukes the throne and became the Sultana of Egypt. Ayyubids lost control of the country. \n
   The Syrian Ayyubids and the Abbasid 哈里发al-Mustasim refused to recognize Shajar al-Durr as the rightful ruler of Egypt, but the Mamluks confirmed their oath to the new sultana and assigned Aybek the title “atabek”. In July 1250, Shajar al-Durr became the wife of Aybek and refused the throne in his favor. To strengthen his position and satisfy his opponents in Syria and Baghdad, Aybek proclaimed himself the atabek (guardian) of the six-year-old al-Ashraf Musa, the grandson of the Sultan al-Kamil. \n
   Despite this, the Syrian Ayyubid al-Nasir Yusuf sent troops to conquer Egypt and overthrow Aybek, but they were defeated first by the emir Fariz al-Din Aktay, and then by Aybek himself. Feeling confident after these victories, Aibek imprisoned his co-ruler Musa and appointed Kutuza the vice-sultan (1252).

After defeating al-Nasir Yusuf and suppressing the uprising, Aktay’s authority among the Mamluks increased significantly, and he began to pose a threat to Aybek’s power. Having conspired with Kutuz and other Mamluks, Aybek invited Aktay to the citadel and killed him. Seeing the head of Aktay thrown out of the citadel, some Mamluks, among them Beybars and Kalaun, fled to Syria (Damascus) and Jordan at night. Having dealt with Aktaimi and his Mamluks, Aibek sent the boy Musa to his aunt, whom he lived with before being made co-ruler. Now Aibek was the absolute and sole ruler of Egypt and part of Syria, but soon after that he entered into a new agreement with al-Nasir Yusuf, which limited his power only to Egypt. \n
   Feeling the need to enter into an alliance with a strong ruler who would help him in the fight against the Mamluks who fled to Syria, Aybek decided to marry the daughter of Badr al-Din Lu’Lu, Emir Mosul. Shajar al-Durr felt betrayed by the man whom she had made the Sultan, and killed Aybek. At the time of his death, he was about sixty years old. Aybek had several sons, including Nasir al-Din khan and al-Mansur Ali. Fifteen-year-old Ali became the new sultan with Kutuz as vice sultan.

So at the beginning of the XIII century, Arslan Shah I Mosulsky tried to seize from his cousin Qutb ad-Din Muhammad that belongs to that Sinjar, since he recognized the supremacy of the Egyptian sultan Al-Adil. Muzaffar ad-din, related by kinship with this sultan, ravaged the town of Nineve in the vicinity of Mosul and then retreated to Irbil. \n
   The joint actions of Muzaffar al-Din, Qutb al-Din Muhammad and Malik Ashraf Musa (Al-Adil's son) led to the fact that in the battle near the village of Kafar-Zammaru, Arslan Shah I lost his entire army and fled to Mosul with four satellites. \n
   In 1218, the ruler of Mosul Masoud II ibn Arslan Shah died. He transferred power to the ten-year-old son Arslan Shah II and regent Badr ad-Din Lulu. But Uncle Arslan Shah II, Imad-ad-din Zengi, ruler of the fortresses of Acre and Shush, did not agree with this. Imad-ad-din Zengi, second-hand Muzaffar ad-din Kookburi attacked the Mosul possessions. They managed to capture the fortresses of Hakkar and Zavzan. After the intervention of Al-Ashraf, to which Badr al-Din turned to for help (Aybek’s squad was sent), the army of the attackers was defeated and peace was made.

{Muzaffar_adDin3_desc}In 1219 Arslan Shah II died and his three-year-old brother Mahmoud Nasir al-Din was Badr al-Din Lulu proclaimed the new Atabek Mosul. Imad ad-din again tried to capture Mosul. Taking advantage of the fact that Badr al-Din sent a part of the troops, led by his son, to help Al-Ashraf and his brother Al-Kamil in Egypt, Imad al-Din went on a campaign. Badr al-Din recalled Aybek’s troops in Nisibin. Not far from Mosul, the troops of Imad al-Din and Muzaffar al-Din of Irbil met with opponents, and the battle took place again. Aibek was able to defeat Imad al-Din, who fought on the left flank, but Muzaffar al-Din, who fought in the center, defeated Badr al-Din. After the battle, Muzaffar ad-din left for Irbil and peace was again made. \n
   In 1224, Jalal ad-Din of Mankburn began a campaign in Mesopotamia. Having wintered in the Khuzistan city of Shuster, he sent a proposal to Baghdad to conclude an alliance against the Mongols. The Baghdad 哈里发in response to the vassals: Kush-Temur and Muzaffar al-Din of Irbil led 10,000 armies to punish the insolent. \n
   In 1230, during the conquests of Jalal ad-Din Mankburna in the Middle East, the ambassadors of al-Mustansir came to him and they asked that Jalal ad-Din not demand submission from Badr al-Din Lulu (who ruled Mosul), Muzaffar al-Din (who ruled Irbil ), Shihab ad-din and Imad ad-Din Pahlavan (ruler of al-Jibal) as they are vassals of the caliph.

{Al_AdillII}传记
{Al_AdillII_desc}Al-Adil Sayf al-Din Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad - the seventh sultan from the Ayubid dynasty, who ruled Egypt in 1238-1240; commander. \n
   His father al-Kamil died on March 8, 1238, and al-Adil became his successor. At this time, anarchy in the state grew rapidly. Al-Mujahid Shirkuh II ibn Muhammad, the emir of Homs, attacked his neighbor and rival Taj al-Din, the emir of Hama. There was also a power struggle in Damascus, and the stepbrother of al-Adil al-Salih Ayyub ibn Muhammad took power in early 1239. Al-Adil entered into an alliance with his uncle al-Salih Ismail. \n
   Meanwhile, Ayyub made an alliance with his cousin, al-Nasir Daoud, the former emir of Damascus and the emir of Kerak. Ayub hoped to take control of Egypt, and al-Nasir - Damascus. Ayyub’s troops moved to Egypt, and in the face of it, al-Adil’s troops. On May 31, 1240, near Bilbeis, the Mamelukes Ayyub surrounded the tent of al-Adil and forced him to announce the transfer of the throne to Ayyub. \n
   Al-Adil was sent to prison in Cairo and died on February 9, 1248. He left the son of Fet al-Din Umar. The coup, organized by the Mamluks in May 1240, was a prelude to the period when they began to play a decisive role in the life of Egypt. Ayyub, obliged to the Mamluks by the throne, only kindled their conceit. When Turan Shah II Ibn Ayyub, the son and successor of Ayyub, tried to take control of them, the Mamluks killed him and put an end to the Ayyubid Sultanate.

{Muhammad_alGalib_desc}Muhammad I ibn Yusuf (1194 - 1273) - Emir of Granada from 1232. \n
  After the defeat of the Almohad at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, their influence on Muslim Spain was significantly weakened. The final loss of power they were obliged to the rebellion of Ibn Hood. Although Ibn Hood was able to capture almost all areas inhabited by Muslims in Spain, he failed to defend these territories from Catholic troops. In 1232, Muhammad ibn Nasr rebelled in the Archon region and proclaimed himself emir. \n
  He had to submit to Ibn Hood in 1234, but in 1237 Muhammad conquered Granada, which became the capital of his state. Thanks to the recognition of the authority of the Castilian crown in 1245, Muhammad managed to preserve the Emirate of Granada as the only independent Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula. \n
  Subsequently, during the reign of Muhammad I, the economy developed rapidly. The population of the Granada emirate has also grown due to the resettlement of Muslims here from areas occupied by Christians. Thanks to this, the imbalance in the size of the Arab and Berber population, which had previously taken place, was equalized. However, the emirate’s foreign trade still depended heavily on the 13th-century Christian maritime powers of Aragon and Genoa. \n
  At the end of his reign, Muhammad I found himself in conflict with Castile. King Alphonse X went on a campaign against the emir, reached Granada and forced the Muslims to increase the tribute paid to Castile. Then Muhammad assisted the Castilian aristocracy, opposition to Alfonso. \n
  In 1273, some of its provinces rebelled against the emir. Muhammad I, who marched against the rebels, was ambushed and killed in the vicinity of Granada. After his death, a strong, viable Muslim state remained, which was able to resist the Christian armies advancing from the north for more than 200 years.

{Abd_alVahid}传记
{Abd_alVahid_desc}Abu Muhammad Abd al-Wahid ibn Abu Hafs, or Abd al-Wahid (d. 1222) - the first ruler (wadi) of the Hafsids in Ifricia in 1207-1222. \n
   Abd al-Wahid was the grandson of Sheikh Abu Hafs Umar from the Khintat of the Sanhaji tribe. Nevertheless, he abandoned his Berber origin, believing him to be noble enough, and impersonating a native of Yemen and a descendant of the 哈里发Umar ibn al-Khattab. \n
   Abd al-Wahid accompanied 哈里发Almohad Muhammad al-Nasir on his expedition to Ifricia in 1205. In February 1206, the 哈里发entered Tunisia, previously abandoned by the enemy. Before leaving for Morocco, the 哈里发entrusted the administration of the province of Abd al-Wahid, one of his trusted lieutenants. This strengthened the authority of Abd al-Wahid to such an extent that his successors ceased to consider themselves governors and freed themselves from the rule of Almohad in 1229. The new kingdom soon extended its power to Bejaia and a number of neighboring regions. \n
   Abd al-Wahid was succeeded by his eldest son Abdullah ibn Abd al-Wahid, but he had barely declared independence when he was overthrown by his brother Abu Zakaria Yahya I, who strengthened his throne and forced his brother to agree to the title of Sheikh and devote himself to religious life.

{Abdullah_alAdil}传记 (1st part)
{Abdullah_alAdil_desc}Abu Muhammad Abdullah al-Adil (d. October 4, 1227) - the seventh 哈里发of the Almohad dynasty, ruler of Morocco in 1224-1227. He was the governor of al-Andalus and achieved the overthrow of his predecessor, Abd al-Wahid I. His rise to power opened a period of instability that lasted even after his death, and is often regarded as one of the catastrophic events in the history of the state of Almohad. The al-Adil coup split the ruling dynasty and ultimately led to the collapse of the caliphate. \n
   Abdullah was the son of the famous Yakub al-Mansur and brother of the 哈里发Muhammad al-Nasir. Along with his other brothers, Abdullah served as governor of the Almohad in Al-Andalus. \n
   After the untimely death of his nephew, the young 哈里发Yusuf II al-Mustansir, in January 1224, the palace nobility in Marrakech, led by the vizier Abu Saeed Osman ibn Jami and the sheikhs of the Masmud clan, secured the election of the cousin of the late ruler, Abd al -Wahida, and presented this election to the other members of the Almohad family as a fait accompli. Abdullah, who ruled Murcia at that time, and his brothers, Abu al-Ala Idris, Abu Musa and Abu al-Hasan, the rulers of Cordoba, Malaga and Granada respectively, formed a powerful coalition against Abd al-Wahid. Abd al-Wahid, despite his advanced age, was a staunch supporter of the centralization of the state, which did not suit the rulers of al-Andalus. \n
   The Almohad dynasty first encountered a succession crisis. Despite the differences, the members of the dynasty always loyally perceived the chosen caliph, so the rebellion was definitely not an accidental event. Abdullah visited a certain Abu Zayd ibn Yudjan, a former senior official in Marrakesh, who was expelled several years ago by the vizier ibn Jami and was now in exile near Chinchilla de Monte Aragon in Murcia.
{Abdullah_alAdil_effects_desc}..

{Abdullah_alAdil2}传记 (2nd part)
{Abdullah_alAdil2_desc}Ibn Yujan convinced Abdullah to run for the election, assuring him of the availability of valuable connections at the court in Marrakesh, as well as among the sheikhs of Masmud. After conferring with his brothers, Abdullah soon declared himself the new 哈里发Almohad, taking the throne name “al-Adil” (“Just”), captured Sevilla and began to prepare for a campaign on Marrakesh. However, Ibn Yujan has already established his Moroccan ties. Until the end of summer, Abu Zakaria, the Sheikh of the Hintat tribe, and Yusuf ibn Ali, the governor of Tinmal, supported al-Adil and captured the palace of Marrakesh, overthrew the 哈里发and expelled ibn Jami. The ousted 哈里发Abd al-Wahid I was strangled in September 1224. \n
   Al-Adil's violation of the rules of dynastic seniority shocked the rest of the Almohad family. However, it did not come to open resistance to the new Caliph. In Al-Andalus, Abdullah and his brothers promptly ousted everyone who refused to acknowledge the change of power. Al-Adil was opposed even by three of his cousins ​​(the sons of Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Abi Hafs, governor of Ifricia) - Abu Zayd (governor of Valencia), Abdullah al-Bayyasi (governor of Jaen) and Abu Dabbus - but they were immediately deprived of their posts. Abdullah al-Bayyashi (“Ba'esiye”) led away a small group of his supporters and set up camp in the mountains of Baezi, calling for an open rebellion against al-Adil. \n
   In Morocco, Abdullah's positions were more precarious. Many tribal sheikhs of the Masmud clan, not wanting to strengthen the Spanish branch of the dynasty, to which Abdullah belonged, refused to ratify the transfer of power to al-Adil and began to rally around his nephew, Yahya ibn al-Nasir. In response, Abdullah al-Adil made a fateful decision to begin the transfer of the bulk of his army from Spain through the Strait to Morocco, intending to go to Marrakesh and suppress the resistance of the sheikhs.
{Abdullah_alAdil2_effects_desc}..

{Abdullah_alAdil3}传记 (3rd part)
{Abdullah_alAdil3_desc}When planning to leave with the army in Morocco, al-Adil did not take seriously the threat from al-Bayyashi and sent only a small detachment against him in the winter of 1224/1225. The detachment was destroyed by supporters of al-Bayyashi, which severely hit the authority of al-Adil. The 哈里发quickly gained a reputation as an incompetent and weak military leader, which inspired his opponents and undermined the loyalty of the allies. Expecting to capture Marrakesh before it was too late, al-Adil decided to ignore al-Bayyashi and continued to transfer troops across the strait to the south. Al-Bayyashi, at the same time, entered into an alliance with Fernando III of Castile. The Christian king, learning about the movement of Almohad troops from Spain, decided to take advantage of the situation and allocated a large Castilian army to help al-Bayyashi. \n
   In 1225, supporters of al-Bayyashi, accompanied by the Castilian army, descended from the Baeza mountains. Taking advantage of the lack of Almohad troops, they devastated the surroundings of Jaén, Vega de Granada, and by the end of the summer they even captured Cordoba. Alfonso IX Leon and Sanshu II of Portugal also seized the opportunity and carried out their own raids against Muslim possessions. The Portuguese troops, not meeting the resistance, advanced rapidly and reached the outskirts of Seville at the end of 1225. \n
   On October 4, 1227, he died under unclear circumstances (according to chroniclers, he drowned in the palace bath). His nephew and rival, Yahya ibn al-Nasir (the throne name of Abu Zakaria al-Mutasim), was elected the new caliph.

   After the death of Abdullah, a civil war broke out between Idris and his nephew Yahya, who received the support of the nobility of Marrakesh. Idris turned to Fernando III of Castile for help and received from him 12,000 knights who allowed Idris to conquer Marrakesh and kill the sheikhs who supported Yahya. \n
   Raised in Spain, Idris, relying on the Christian army that occupied Marrakech, decided on radical religious transformations. He abandoned the Mahdi doctrine in favor of Sunni Islam. He went so far as to claim that the Mahdi was Jesus, and not Ibn Tumart, the founder of the Almohad dynasty and teachings. This caused the actual collapse of the state: the Hafsids of Ifricia declared separation. Unable to pay Fernando for help, Idris started the construction of a Christian church in Marrakesh in 1230, which was eventually destroyed two years later. The radical transformation of Idris very soon deprived him of the support of the nobility and the people. As a result, at the beginning of 1232, when he besieged Ceuta, Yahya took the opportunity to capture Marrakech. Idris died during the transition from Ceuta to the capital, and he was succeeded by his eldest son Abd al-Wahid ar-Rashid.

   Abd al-Wahid succeeded his father Abu Al al-Mamun, who died in a campaign against Yahya, who took control of the capital Marrakesh. The rule of al-Wahid marked the beginning of the final stage in the collapse of the state of Almohad. He was unable to oust Yahya from Marrakesh, and the emir of Tlemcen declared his independence in 1236, having established the Abdalvadid dynasty (following the example of the Hafsids in Tunisia). \n
   In 1242, al-Wahid ordered the governor to gather forces to counter Abu Yahya ibn Abd al-Haqq, the founder of the Marinid state, who captured Fes. However, in December of the same year, the 哈里发died under unclear circumstances in his own palace (according to some, he drowned in the pool, and according to others, he died from a fall from a height).

{Dgelal_Manguberdi}传记 (1st part)
{Dgelal_Manguberdi_desc}Jalal ad-Din Manguberdi - the last Khorezmshah (from 1220) from the Anushteginids dynasty, immigrants from the Oguz-Turkmen tribe, the eldest son of Al ad-Din Muhammad II and his Turkmen wife Aichic. \n
   Jalal ad-Din came to power in February 1221 after the death of his father, Khorezmshah Muhammad II. Headed the struggle of Khorezm against the Mongol invasion. Gathering 300 loyal warriors, Jalal ad-Din went to Khorasan. In the Nisa district, the Khorezmians attacked a Mongolian detachment of 700 people and defeated it. Genghis Khan was forced to send a special detachment to Khorezm and Khorasan, which encountered the army of the younger sons of Al ad-din Mohammed. In a fierce battle, both brothers Jalal ad-Din died. \n
   Jalal ad-Din himself was advancing towards Ghazni at that time. In the upper reaches of the Murghab, he was joined by the former governor of MervaKhan-Malik and the Turkmen khan Seyf al-Din. Arriving in Ghazni, Jalal ad-Din soon gathered an army of ten thousand, attacked with him the Mongol detachment besieging Kandahar, and defeated him. The warlords of the defeated Khorezm detachments, having heard about the successes of their ruler, began to gather in Ghazni, and soon under the command of Jalal ad-Din there were about 70 thousand soldiers. Under his banner came a cousin Amin al-Mulk, commander Timur-Malik, khan Karluk Azam-Malik and the leader of the Afghans Muzaffar-Malik. Genghis Khan, not yet aware of the forces of Khorezmshah, sent a 30,000-strong army against him under the command of Shigi-Kutuku. \n
   In the spring, the advancing army of Jalal ad-Din stumbled upon the advance detachment of Shigi-Kutuku near the village of Valian on the Gori River. The Mongolian detachment was almost completely killed: only a hundred soldiers were saved. Then Jalal ad-Din went to the gorge, where he began to wait for the battle. Shigi-Kutuku moved his entire army to this place. Both armies converged in a rocky gorge, squeezed by steep cliffs.
{Dgelal_Manguberdi_effects_desc}..*

{Dgelal_Manguberdi2}传记 (2nd part)
{Dgelal_Manguberdi2_desc}For the cavalry, the terrain was unfavorable, and both sides were forced to refrain from maneuvering. Jalal ad-Din ordered Temurmalik to move forward with the archers on foot. Shigi-Kutuku lasted the first day, despite the fact that the Khorezmians, finding the enemy’s weak spot, climbed the rocks and began to shoot at the Mongols from above, which caused serious damage to the Mongolian army. The next morning, the soldiers of Jalal ad-Din, looking around the gorge, saw that the Mongol army had become more numerous. In fact, Shigi-Kutuku ordered that the stuffed animals wrapped in rags be planted on spare horses. Khorezmshah reassured his commanders and ordered the dismount of the entire first line of his army. The Mongol attack on the left wing of the enemy came under a hail of arrows. Then Shigi-Kutuku ordered to attack the enemy on the entire front. However, the hail of arrows and rocky terrain did not allow the Mongols to develop success. Jalal ad-Din put his warriors in the saddle and launched a counterattack. Taken aback, the Mongols fled. Warriors of the Khorezmshah attacked the retreating enemy, and Shigi-Kutuku lost half of his army. Many researchers note that the defeat of the Mongolian forces under Parvan was the only major defeat of the Mongols during the entire period of their military operations in Central Asia, Iran and Afghanistan during the campaign of Genghis Khan to the West. \n
   After the defeat of the Mongols near Parvan, Genghis Khan, at the head of the main forces, himself moved to Jalal ad-Din. He overtook him on the banks of the Indus River on December 9, 1221. Khorezmshah built an army with a crescent moon, resting both flanks in the river. The Mongols fell on the flanks, which were soon defeated. The center tried to break through, but most of the warriors were destroyed. Jalal ad-Din ordered to drown his entire harem in the river, and then, in order not to be captured, he rushed with his horse from a large cliff into the waters of the Indus River.

{Dgelal_Manguberdi3_desc}Khorezmshah with 4 thousand horsemen managed to reach the other side of the Indus and even threaten the Mongols with a sword. In the battle, the family of Jalal ad-Din was captured and executed, he himself went to India. According to legend, Genghis Khan, delighted with the courage of the young sultan, told his sons: "This is how a father should have a son." For the persecution, Genghis Khan allocated a detachment led by the temniks Balo-noion and Durban. But, reaching the city of Multan, the Mongols lost the trace of the Sultan. \n
   In the Shatra district, the local Indian ruler, learning about the appearance of Jalal ad-Din with the remnants of the army in his vicinity, gathered 5 thousand foot soldiers and a thousand horsemen and opposed him. Suddenly, Jalal ad-Din himself attacked the enemy. He personally shot the wound, whose troops after a short battle took to flight. Three years before the beginning of 1224, Jalal ad-Din spent in India, undertook a campaign in Iran and Mesopotamia, conquered vast areas. \n
   In 1225, Jalal ad-Din from the south invaded northern Iran. Having taken Maragha, which did not show serious resistance, the sultan went to Tabriz and took possession of the city. Atabek Uzbek fled to Ganzak, and from there to the impregnable fortress of Alinja, where he died. In a short time, the power of Jalal ad-Din recognized Ganja, Bard, Shamkir and other cities of Arran. In 1225, Jalal ad-Din troops captured part of Georgia and Armenia. On August 8, 1225, near the city of Dvin in Eastern Armenia, a battle went down in history as the Battle of Garni takes place between the Georgian-Armenian army and the Jalal ad-Din army. Khorezmshah won in it. In 1226, he captured and ravaged the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, where Khorezmshah destroyed all the churches.

The Shirvanshahs also recognized themselves as vassals of Jalal ad-Din. The following 1227, Jalal ad-Din defeated a Mongol detachment near Ray. By this time, he waged a war on two fronts: in western Iran - against the Mongols, in Transcaucasia - with Georgians and Armenians. In 1228, the Roman sultan Ala ad-Din Kay-Kubad, the Egyptian sultan Malik al-Kamil and the Cilician-Armenian king Khetum I, jointly opposed Khorezmshah, defeated the troops of Jalal ad-Din near Yerevan. In 1230, Jalal ad-Din captured the Khlat fortress, but was soon defeated by Kay-Kubad and Malik al-Kamil. \n
   The governors of the Khorezmshah outraged in the conquered territories, demanded a large lodge. On the robbery and atrocities of the Khorezmites, the people answered with uprisings. Especially powerful was the performance of the urban poor Ganja led by the craftsman Bendar in 1231. The uprising was crushed, 30 of its leaders were executed, but it significantly weakened Jalal ad-Din. Through the ruler of Alamut, the Mongols learned that Jalal ad-Din was weakened by a recent defeat. In the same year, the 30,000th Mongol army led by Chormagan easily defeated Jalal ad-Din and occupied northern Iran. Khorezmshah retreated to Ganja. The Mongols followed him and captured Arran. Jalal ad-Din took refuge in the Mayyafarikin mountains and here in August of that year he was killed by an unknown Kurd, allegedly employed by the Seljuks.

{KeiHosrovv}传记 (1st part)
{KeiHosrovv_desc}Giyas ad-Din Kay-Khosrov II - Seljuk ruler of the Koni Sultanate (1236 / 1237-1246). The heir and probable poisoner of his father Kei-Kubad I. Having become a sultan, Kay-Khosrov married his sister to Malik Aziz, son of Muhammad, Ayyubid ruler of Aleppo, and he married the daughter of the latter. The second wife of Kei-Khosrov was Tamara, the daughter of the Georgian Tsarina Rusudan. \n
   Weak in character, Kay-Khosrov fell under the influence of the powerful nobleman Saad ad-Din Köpek, who helped him ascend to the throne. Emir Saad ad-Din Köpek, who became the first minister of the Seljuk Sultanate, arbitrarily deposed and executed prominent statesmen, appropriating their property. However, the Sultan was tired of the omnipotence of the Emir Köpek and in 1239 he was killed by the Emir of Sivas, Husameddin Karaja and Ertogrul Bey. Nevertheless, the political crisis did not affect the military successes of the Sultanate. Victories were won at Diyarbakir and Tars, and Kilikia, the Trebizond emperor and ruler of Aleppo declared themselves vassals of Kei-Khosrov II.
{KeiHosrovv_effects_desc}..

{KeiHosrovv2}传记 (2nd part)
{KeiHosrovv2_desc}A constant influx of refugees from the east, mainly nomadic Turks fleeing the Mongol conquest, set the stage for a social explosion. In 1239, an uprising of Bab Ishaq, a Sufi sheikh who declared himself “the messenger of Allah,” broke out in the eastern regions of the state. Baba Ishaq and his Shiite supporters called for the overthrow of the “tyrant,” the Sunni Sultan. The rebels were able to defeat the army directed against them and enter the city of Amasya. With great difficulty, the Sultan managed to crush the rebellion. All its participants with families, except for children under the age of three, were killed. \n
   In 1242, the Mongols invaded the Sultanate, weakened by the internal crisis. The army of the commander Baiju-noion captured Erzurum, and the next year defeated the numerically superior army of Kei-Khosrov at Kösä-dag. After that, the sultan lost the cities of Sivas, Kayseri and Erzincan. Kay-Khosrov fled to Konya, instructing Emir Mudhahib al-Din and Kadi Amasya to negotiate with the Mongols. Under the terms of the world, the sultan was supposed to send about 12 million hyperperons or local silver coins, 500 pieces of silk, 500 camels and 5,000 rams to Karakoram. Kay-Khosrov sent ambassadors with recognition of vassal dependence on Batu, the ruler of Ulus Jochi. Soon the state was divided into two parts: the land was left to the Sultan west of the Kyzyl-Yrmak River, and the area east of it was directly controlled by the Mongol governor.

{ErtugrulI}传记
{ErtugrulI_desc}Ertogrul (d. 1281/82) - Turkic (representative of the Oguz tribe Kayi) ruler, father of the founder of the Ottoman dynasty Osman I. The rules in the middle of the XIII century in the territory, called the Ottoman beilik, with a center in the city of Sogyut. \n
   Oruj-bek wrote: "Osman's father is said to have been of very low descent: a simple soldier named Ertogrul." \n
   Alaeddin Kay-Kubad granted Ertogrul UJ (the outskirts of the Sultanate) to the lot. A part of the Kayi tribe migrated to Anatolia from Central Asia, where the Kayi leaders were in the service of the rulers of Khorezm for some time. A small unit of kayy (400-500 tents), headed by Ertogrul, fleeing the Mongol raids, went into the possession of the Seljuk Sultan Alaeddin Kay-Kubad and turned to him for patronage. \n
   Strengthening of Kaya and the expansion of the Beylik territory was facilitated by the struggle of the Koni Sultanate with the Mongols. Alaeddin paid them tribute from 1236, and in 1243, at the Battle of Kös-dag, the new Sultan, Kay-Khosrov II, suffered a crushing defeat. Kaya was also forced to agree to pay tribute to the Mongols. \n
   The date of death of Ertogrul is indicated by various sources as 1281/82. Legends also say that Ertogrul died at the age of 80–90 years. Neshri indicates that Ertogrul lived 93 years.

{KilichIV_Arslannnn_desc}Kylych-Arslan IV (Rukn ad-din Kylych-Arslan bin Kay-Khosrov) - Sultan of Ruma, who ruled in 1246-1264. \n
   Sultan Kay-Khosrov II was killed by his own courtiers in 1246. After his death, the Mongol governor Khulagu decided to transfer power in the Koni Sultanate to the eldest son of the deceased - Kay-Kavusu II. \n
   After the defeat at Köse-dag, on the outskirts of the Sultanate, independent possessions of the Turkmen leaders began to appear, who were actively engaged in robbery and attacked the cities. Cavus managed to put things in order, but then feuds with Arslan began. \n
   Fearing a civil war, the Mongols handed over control to the three sons of Khosrov - Kay-Kavus II, Kay-Kubad II and Kilich-Arslan IV. \n
   However, joint rule was an unfortunate idea: the brothers constantly intrigued against each other and outbid the mercenaries. The last straw was the decision of Cavus to appoint the Byzantine exile Mikhail Paleolog as commander of the Christian mercenaries, because of which there were rumors about the conversion of the Sultan to Christianity. Arslan spoke of this most of all, and his elder brother sent him to prison and released him only under pressure from the Mongols. The youngest brother - Kay-Kubad II with news of the freedom of Arslan was sent to the headquarters of the Mongols, but died on the way back in 1257.
{KilichIV_Arslannnn_effects_desc}..

{KilichIV_Arslannnn2}传记 (2nd part)
{KilichIV_Arslannnn2_desc}According to the decision of Hulagu-khan, Kavus received land to the west of the Galas river, and Arslan - to the east. But the older brother considered these conditions unprofitable and began negotiations with the Egyptian Mamelukes about joint actions against the Mongols. They heard about the conspiracy, and Kavus fled to the Nicene emperor Theodore II Laskaris, where he stayed. \n
   Having become the sole Sultan of Rum in 1260, Arslan possessed little power, since he was a Mongol tributary. The nomads vigilantly followed him and in 1264 allowed his minister Suleiman the First Muin ad-din, who completely influenced the ruler, to kill him. \n
   After the murder, he proclaimed the new sovereign the son of the murdered - Kay-Khosrov III. Due to his infancy, power in the country passed into the hands of the Mongol governors. Kylych-Arslan IV was buried in the mosque of Al Al-Din in Konya.

{Kei_KavussII_desc}Izz ad-dunya wa d-din Kay-Kavus II (d. 1279) - the Koni Sultan (1245-1256, 1257-1261). \n
   Izz al-Din Kay-Kavus was the eldest son of the Koni Sultan Giyas al-Din Kay-Khosrov II; his mother was the concubine of the Sultan, the daughter of a Greek priest. According to his will, the 继承人Kay-Khosrov should have become his youngest son Ala ad-Din Kay-Kubad, from the Georgian princess Tamar (Gyurzhi-Khatun), daughter of Tsarina Rusudan. But after the death of Kay-Khosrov (1245/1246), the powerful vizier Shams ad-Din Isfahani spoke in support of Kay-Kavus, married his mother, executed several dissenting emirs and concentrated power in his hands. P.I. Zhavoronkov, referring to the information of Kirakos Gandzaketsi, claims that Kay-Kavus ascended the throne, relying on kinship with the Nicene emperor and his help. \n
   However, the vizier could not prevent the actions of Rukn al-Din Kılıç-Arslan, the middle brother, who, accompanied by several emirs, went to Karakorum, the capital of the Mongol Empire, hoping that the kaan would give the reign to him. The Seljuks were present at the great kurultai of 1246, where Guyuk was elected kaan. Kylych-Arslan received a label from the new Khan. Guyuk, in response to a complaint from the emirs, ordered the vizier Shams ad-Din to be handed over to the relatives of the nobles killed by him. Upon the return of Kılıç-Arslan to Asia Minor, he was recognized as the Sultan, and Shams ad-Din Isfahani was put to death (1249). \n
   By this time, it became known about the death of the kagan of the Mongol Empire Guyuk. Since the new khan was not elected, the Seljuk emirs agreed that all three sons of Kei-Khosrov II should reign together: in 647–655. H. / 1249-1257 years. n e. three names are minted on coins.
{Kei_KavussII_effects_desc}..

{Kei_KavussII2}传记 (2nd part)
{Kei_KavussII2_desc}But in 1254 Kılıç-Arslan was recognized as the Kayseri only sultan; coins with his name were minted in the city. Negotiations failed, and at the end of 1254 - the beginning of 1255 between Kei-Khosrov and Kylych-Arslan the struggle for sole power began. The first relied on the Greeks, the second on the Mongols. Kylych-Arslan was defeated and was imprisoned in the fortress of Buruglu. \n
   The Mongol governor Baiju-noyon invaded the Sultanate on the pretext that Kay-Kavus delayed the payment of tribute. The Sultan, with the support of the Turkmen tribes, came forward to meet the Mongols and on October 14, 1256, two troops met near Aksaray. Kay-Kavus, in whose army the Greek detachment fought under the command of the future Byzantine emperor Michael Paleolog, was defeated and fled to his ally Theodore II Laskar. Rukn ad-Din Kılıç-Arslan IV regained freedom and was again recognized as the Sultan. Kay-Cavus arrived in the Sardis at the beginning of January 1257 to the Nicene emperor. Theodore gave Kay-Kavus a detachment of 400 horsemen in exchange for Laodicea and the Hones with two fortresses. Upon learning that the Mongol troops had retreated, Kay-Kavus returned to Konya, while Kılıç-Arslan stayed in Kayseri. \n
   Following this, Kay-Kavus and Kılıç-Arslan went to Tabriz, at the headquarters of Hulag, the leader of the Mongol campaign in the Middle East (according to Rashid ad-Din, this happened in August 1258, according to Abul al-Fide, in 657 Kh. = December 28, 1258 — December 18, 1259 A.D.) Khulagu was extremely dissatisfied with Kei-Kavus' speech against Baiju-noion, but, at the request of Dokuz-hatun, forgave him.
{Kei_KavussII2_effects_desc}..

{Kei_KavussII3}传记 (3rd part)
{Kei_KavussII3_desc}Both brothers took part in the Hulagu campaign in northern Syria and returned to Rum when the Hulagu retreated east. Then, suspecting Kay-Kavus in secret relations with the Mamelukes, Khulag ordered Kylich-Arslan to move with his troops against his brother. With the support of the Mongolian forces, Kilich-Arslan ousted Kay-Kavus from his capital, Konya, and he was forced to flee first to Antalya, and then to Constantinople, to the court of Mikhail Paleolog. \n
   In the fall of 1261 (or in the winter of 1260), Michael VIII and Hulagu signed a secret friendship treaty, one of the points of which was to be kept under house arrest under the Byzantine court of Kei-Kavus. In 1265, a joint Mongolian-Bulgarian campaign against Byzantium took place. The Golden Horde ruler Berke intended to release Kay-Kavus II from prison, as requested by the brother of the latter, Rukn ad-Din Kylych-Arslan IV. The allied forces did not attack Constantinople, but went to the town of Enos, located at the mouth of the Maritsa, on the shores of the Aegean Sea, where, under the pretext of meeting with the emperor, Kay-Kavus had moved shortly before. Having liberated the Sultan and captured many inhabitants of Thrace, the Horde returned to the Kypchak steppes. Kay-Kavus was graciously received by Berke and lived in the Horde for the rest of his life, having received possession of land in the Crimea.

{Skule_Horfager}传记
{Skule_Horfager_desc}Skule Bordsson or Duke Skjul (1189 - 1240) - Norwegian jarl, contender for the throne in 1239-1240. The son of Bord Guttormsson (d. 1194) and Ragnfried Erlingsdotter, brother of King Inge II. During the reign of his brother Inge II, Skule enjoyed great power and influence at the royal court. \n
  In 1217, after the death of the childless king, Inge II, Skule claimed the royal throne, to which Hakon IV Hokonsson, the grandson of Sverrir Sigurdsson, was elected. At the beginning of the reign of Hakon, Skule received the title of jarl and became the de facto ruler of the state. Skule took possession of the third part of Norway and chose Nidaros as his residence. Teaching young Hakon the military art, Skule managed to unite all the warring Norwegian provinces into a single kingdom. It can be said that Skule prepared Norway for the reign of King Hakon. \n
  In 1225, Margaret, daughter of Skule, was married to the young King Hakon IV Hokonsson. However, after reaching the age of majority, Hakon began to seek to rule on his own, and his relationship with the powerful jarl Skule began to deteriorate. Soon, the conflict between King Hakon and the Jarl Skule Bordsson grew into a war. In 1239, in Trondheim, Skul was proclaimed as a supporter by the 国王Norway. \n
  In the first battle with King Hakon’s troops near Loki Skule, Bordsson won, but in the next battle at Oslo he suffered a crushing defeat. In May 1240, after another defeat, Skule with loyal people took refuge in the Elgeseter monastery in Trondheim, but was surrounded by the Hakon warriors who burned the monastery, and Hakon killed Skule in a duel. \n
  With the death of Jarl Skule Bordsson in 1240, the era of civil wars in Norway ended (1130-1240).

The only son of Jarl Haakon the Mad (c. 1170-1214) and Swedish noblewoman Christina Nicholasdotter. His father was the commander of the Norwegian army and regent of the state during the short reign of King Guttorm Sigurdsson (January-August 1204). Maternal great-grandson of the Swedish King Eric IX Saint. \n
   After the death of Haakon the Mad in 1214, his widow Christine, together with her young son Knut, went to Sweden (Westergötland), where she remarried to the nobleman Eskil Magnusson. \n
   In 1226, after the death of Sigurd Ribbung, Knut Hokonsson was elected as a new contender for the royal throne. Soon, the brokers suffered a final defeat from the royal army. In 1227, Knut Hokonsson renounced his claim to the throne and entered into a peace treaty with the Norwegian king Haakon IV Haakonsson. In the same year he married Ingrid (d. 1232), the second daughter of the jarl Skule Bordsson. \n
   In the years 1239-1240, during the uprising of his father-in-law, the Jarl Skule Bordsson, Knut Hokonsson remained faithful to the Norwegian King Haakon IV, who subsequently granted him the title of Jarl. \n
   Subsequently, Knut Hokonsson retained the title of jarl, which formally made him the highest ranking person in the state after the king and his sons. In September 1261, Knut Hokonsson carried the crown at the ceremony of coronation of Magnus VI Lagabet, the youngest son and successor of Hakon IV the Old.

{Olaf_Krovan}传记 (1st part)
{Olaf_Krovan_desc}Olaf Godredarson, also known as Olaf the Black (d. May 21, 1237) - the 国王the Islands from the Scandinavian dynasty of the Krovans (1226-1237), who ruled on the Isle of Man and parts of the Hebrides. \n
   Olaf the Black was the youngest son of Godred Olafsson, 国王the Islands and Dublin (d. 1187), and grandson of Olaf Godredarson, 国王the Islands (d. 1153). Godred inherited from his father the Hebrides off the west coast of Scotland and the Isle of Man, located in the center of the Irish Sea, a strategically important point between Britain and Ireland. In the mid-12th century, Godred lost most of the Inner Hebrides that Somerland, Lord of Argyll captured. \n
   According to the Chronicles of Maine, in 1187, after the death of Godred, the new 国王Maine was his eldest son, Rognvald (d. 1229). It is possible that the mother of Rognvald was an Irish, illegitimate wife or concubine of Godred Olafsson. Before he died, Godred himself wanted to see his heir as the youngest son of Olaf, who was born in a legal marriage. But after his death, the islanders elected Maine Roegnwald as the new king, since his brother Olaf was still a child.
{Olaf_Krovan_effects_desc}..

{Olaf_Krovan2}传记 (2nd part)
{Olaf_Krovan2_desc}The Chronicles of Maine claim that King Rognwald granted Olaf the possession of Lewis Island. In fact, Lewis was the northern part of the island of Lewis and Harris, which today is the largest island in Scotland. The northern part of the island, Lewis, is flat and swampy, and the southern part, Harris, is more mountainous. The Chronicles of Maine describe the island of Olaf as mountainous and rocky, completely unsuitable for agriculture. A small population of the island lived in hunting and fishing. Chronicles report that Olaf went to Rognwald and asked him for more land. On the orders of his elder brother, Olaf was captured and sent to the Scottish king Wilhelm Leo (1165-1214), who held him in prison for almost seven years. Only after the death of William in December 1214, Olaf Godredarson received freedom and returned to his homeland. Olaf met on the Isle of Man with Rognvald, and then went on a pilgrimage with a large group of nobles. \n
   After returning from pilgrimage, Olaf married the sister of his brother Rögnwald’s wife and got the island of Lewis back into possession. Soon, with the assistance of the bishop of the Islands of Reginald and his uncle, Olaf was divorced with his wife under the pretext that his cousin was his concubine before. The Chronicles of Maine report that Olaf married Christine, daughter of the Scottish feudal lord Ferkhar, Earl of Ross, on his second marriage. Olaf’s second marriage caused the discontent of the wife of Rognvald, who sought to sow discord between the half-brothers. The Queen secretly ordered her son Godred to seize and kill Olaf.
{Olaf_Krovan2_effects_desc}..

{Olaf_Krovan3}传记 (3rd part)
{Olaf_Krovan3_desc}The Chronicles of Maine report that Godred Ragnaldsson gathered his forces on the Isle of Skye and attacked the Isle of Lewis, devastating most of it. But his uncle Olaf was able to escape and fled to Scotland, under the protection of his father-in-law Ferhar. Soon Olaf suddenly attacked the Isle of Skye on his nephew Godred, who was captured, blinded and castrated. \n
   According to the Chronicles of Maine, in the summer after the defeat of Godred Olaf, with a fleet of 32 ships, landed on the Isle of Man to oppose his half-brother Rögnwald. But peace was concluded between the brothers, Rögnwald retained the royal title and authority over Maine, and his brother Olaf received the Outer Hebrides. \n
   In 1230, Olaf Godredarson fled to Norway, asking King Hakon Hakonarson for military help against Alan Galloway and members of the Somerland dynasty. The Norwegian king sent a fleet to the South Islands under the command of Uspak, one of the representatives of the Somerland clan. Uspak was proclaimed 国王the Islands by Hakon. Uspak died or was killed at the beginning of the campaign, after which Olaf took control of the Norwegian fleet and regained control of the Isle of Man. The Kingdom of the Islands was divided between Olaf and his nephew Godred Ragnaldsson, who received the Outer Hebrides. Soon Godred was killed on the island of Lewis, and Olaf became autocratic to rule the kingdom until his death in 1237. The sons of Olaf - Harald, Rögnwald and Magnus - occupied the royal throne of the Isle of Man.

{Uspak_Makdugall}传记
{Uspak_Makdugall_desc}Uspak - leader of the Norwegian expedition to the Hebrides and the 国王the Islands in 1230. \n
   Uspak was probably one of the sons of Dougal, 国王the Hebrides and Argyll. For a long time, he stayed at the court of 国王Norway Haakon IV, overlord of the kingdom of the Islands, and, unlike his brothers Duncan and Dougal Skritsch, was a supporter of the Proto-Roman orientation. \n
   In 1230, Haakon IV equipped a fleet of twelve ships to restore its power on the Hebrides. The expedition was led by Uspak, to whom Haakon appropriated the title of 国王the Islands. In Orkney, another twenty ships joined the Uspak fleet. Then the Norwegians headed south, subjugated the MacDougalls of Argyll, and, circling Kintyre, landed on the island of Butte, where they besieged the castle of Rothesay. This fortress belonged to Walter Stewart, the leader of Anglo-Scottish influence on the west coast. Rothsey was soon captured and destroyed, however, the approach of the army of Alan of Galloway forced the Norwegians to retreat. Uspak suddenly fell ill and died (he may have been injured during the siege of the castle), and the fleet returned to Norway. \n
   Uspak’s expedition was King Haakon IV’s first attempt to restore order on the Hebrides, reviving the unity of the Kingdom of the Islands, and establishing Norway’s power in the region.

   His mother was Elena Guttormsdotter, the widow of the Danish nobleman Esburn Snare and the daughter of the Swedish jarl Guttorma. In 1219, Knut received from his father the title of Duke of Revel (Tallinn) in Estonia, but in 1227 the rebel Ests expelled the Danish feudal lords from their land. \n
   In compensation for the loss of Revel, Knut received the possession of the Blekinge province in 1242, which he ruled until his death. In 1246, Duke Knut supported his stepbrothers, the princes Abel and Christopher, in the fight against the Danish king Eric IV, by whose order he was imprisoned in the castle of Stegeborg. The 国王Denmark forced him to exchange Blekinge for the province of Lolland, but soon the Blekinge province was returned to him. \n
   In the 1330s, the 国王Sweden Magnus II (1319–1364) granted the lands of Blekinge and Lister to Knut Folkasson, Knut’s great-grandson.

   The brief period of his reign is marked by a civil war between brothers. Especially fiercely he fought against Abel, the Duke of Schleswig, who sought to take an independent position and was supported by the counts of Holstein. \n
   Eric suppressed the uprising of the peasants of Scania. The reason for the uprising was the heavy taxes imposed by Eric. Taxes were levied on the use of the plow - the so-called "Tax from the plow", because of which he received his nickname (date. Plovpenning). \n
   After a difficult victory over Abel in 1250, Eric negotiated a ceasefire, but in the same year, while traveling through Schleswig, he was captured by his brother and imprisoned, where he was killed, allegedly by Abel people.

   Abel was crowned November 1, 1250 after the death of his brother Eric IV. Eric IV was apparently killed by the people of Abel. Abel was in conflict with his brother, disputing the right to the throne. Although Abel, along with 24 nobles gave the so-called. The "two dozen oath" that he did not participate in the murder, the belief that Eric was killed by order of Abel, is still widespread. \n
   Abel and his wife Mehthilda Holstein ruled in Denmark for 1.5 years. He was killed in battle on June 29, 1252 during a punitive expedition to North Friesland. His son Waldemar was captured by the Archbishop of Cologne for ransom, so the 国王Denmark was the younger brother of Abel Christopher I (who was crowned on Christmas 1252). The Dowager Queen Mehtilda married Jarl Birger in 1261. \n
   Abel's descendants ruled in southern Jutland until 1375, often together with their Holstein relatives. They created a constant problem for the Danish kings because of separatist aspirations.

   Brother of the Danish kings Abel and Eric IV. He was elected king on December 25, 1252 after the death of his elder brother Abel. \n
   Most of the board was engaged in the struggle with its many opponents. After the recognition of the son of Abel Waldemar III as the ruler of southern Jutland, Christopher thwarted his attempts to occupy the Danish throne, but this led to the fact that this border territory became relatively independent from the power of the king. He was also forced to make peace in 1257 with the kings of Norway and Sweden, provoked by Abel's invasions of their territory, and yielded to certain political demands of the Danish nobility. Under him, the Danish medieval Danish parliament was convened for the first time. In 1256, he took part in the Weiji church cathedral. \n
   In 1259, Christopher quarreled with the church due to the refusal to canonize Eric IV. He later ordered the arrest of Archbishop Jacob Erlandsen, who did not want to recognize Prince Eric as the full heir to the throne. After this, Christopher was excommunicated, but apparently not for long, since he was buried according to all Christian rules. The death of the king, which happened in the same year 1259, was very unexpected. He died shortly after receiving Holy Communion, but there is no evidence of his poisoning. Christopher's supporters, however, were convinced of his poisoning and called him “Krist-Offer” (“Christ's Sacrifice”).

{Ulf_Folkung}传记
{Ulf_Folkung_desc}Ulf "Fase" Karlsson (d. 1248) - a jarl of Sweden, one of the Volkung clan. The son of Karl Deaf, the previous jarl who was killed in 1220 during a crusade in Estonia, and cousin of Birger Magnusson. \n
   After the death of Johan Sverkerssson in 1222, Eric Shepelyavy was promoted to the throne. The power of the Jarl Ulf increased, but Knut II, who carried out a coup in 1228, was the regent under the infant king. The result of the coup was the flight of Eric to Denmark and the accession of Knut until 1234. All this time, Ulf Fase remained the bright spot. When the former regent passed away, the matured king returned to his homeland. Ulf was considered a traitor, since he did not interfere with Knut, but they could not dismiss him because of the extremely strong position of the jarl, who took real power into his own hands. \n
   For over 15 years, Ulf Fase was the head of the Volkungs. It was he who for a long time led the country behind the back of the king, but he was not overthrown by opponents, since he did not want harm to his country. What is strange, it is almost not mentioned in the "Chronicle of Eric." After the death of Ulf Fase, his cousin Birger Magnusson, who is considered the leader of the Swedish campaign against Ladoga in 1240, became the jarl. According to the Chronicle of Eric, in 1247 a rebellion was raised against King Eric, but nothing is known about Ulf Fas's participation in it. The causes and circumstances of Ulf Fasse's death also remain unknown. Jarl Ulf had his only son, Karl Ulfson. \n
   The nickname "Fasse" is translated as "Terrible" or as "Vase". Ulf Karlsson had the right to mint his own coins.

{Birgerr_Folkung_desc}Birger Magnusson (d. 1266) - a jarl of Sweden from the Volkung family. \n
  In 1237 he married the sister of King Eric Shepelyavy Ingeborg, who was a relative of Alexander Nevsky. Although the chronicles indicate the “private” nature of Birger's matchmaking, it must be borne in mind that by that time Birger's cousin Ulf Fase was the Jarl for about 15 years, and King Eric Ericsson Shepelyavy had no heirs. \n
  In December 1237, Pope Gregory IX proclaimed a second crusade in Finland, and in the spring of 1238 the Danes and Teutons offered the Swedes a campaign against Novgorod. Birger Jarl went to the Novgorod lands. \n
  During the battle near the Neva River (July 23, 1940), Birger Jarl challenged Alexander Nevsky several times for a duel. Making his way to Alexander through the Russian system, Birger's horse was wounded, so a powerful attack in the duel did not work, and Alexander wounded a spear in the face of Birger Jarl. Having defeated the Swedes left for Finland. \n
  After the death of Ulf Fasse in 1248, Birger, defeating his rivals, became a Swedish jarl and went on an aggressive campaign in Finland, but returned after receiving news of the death of King Eric Shepelyavy (1250). \n
  The nobility opposed Birger becoming the new king, but he seated his eleven-year-old son Waldemar on the throne and became regent with him. The rebellion began, but Birger Jarl crushed him. \n
  Legislator and builder, diplomat and skilled ruler, Stockholm founder Birger Jarl ensured Sweden a quiet life for a hundred years. He died in 1266.

   He participated in the struggle of his father against Vsevolod Chermny in 1206–1210, led the campaign against Lithuania in 1207, and participated in the Battle of Lipitsky (1216). The chronicle informs about the invasion of Vladimir in Kiev in 1219, which is usually understood as his invasion in Kiev land, presumably in Ovruch, after the death of his older brother Rostislav. He participated in the Battle of Kalka, and is traditionally considered to be the Prince of Smolensk, who in those years was Mstislav Davydovich. After the death of Kstka Mstislav the Old, Vladimir took the great reign of Kiev. In 1225-1227 he helped his other cousin, Mstislav Galitsky, in the struggle against the Polish feudal lords and Daniil Volynsky, then in alliance with Daniel - against Mikhail Chernigovsky and his ally Izyaslav in 1234-1236. Together with Daniil, he besieged Chernigov, but was defeated at Torsky, was captured by the Polovtsy and lost the Kiev reign in favor of Izyaslav (1235).

   When his father, Prince Roman Mstislavich, died in 1205, Vasilko was only two years old, his elder brother Daniil was four. Their mother turned to the help of the Hungarian king Andrei II, a Hungarian detachment appeared in Galich. The campaign of Rurik of Kiev and Olgovich to Galich was unsuccessful. The Galician boyars invited Vladimir Igorevich to reign, the princess with the children fled to Volyn, but the Igorevichs demanded the extradition of the Romanovichs, and the princess took the children to the Polish prince Leshka Bely. Since 1208 Vasilko reigned in Berestye. His first speech was the help he provided to his brother Daniel during the expulsion of the Igorevichs from Galich and other cities (1211). Both princes began to own the principality together. After the Polish-Hungarian congress in Spis (1214) and the establishment of Polish-Hungarian domination in the Galician-Volyn land, Leshko forced Alexander Vsevolodovich to give Vladimir Romanovich, which was an important step in returning their father’s inheritance. Then Vladimir constantly remained the throne of Vasilka, and Daniel fought for Galich. In 1219, the Romanovichs took away a number of cities on the western border from Leshka, which led to a gap between them, but in the 1220s, Leshko again helped the Romanovichs against Alexander Vsevolodovich (and Mstislav Udatny). Having received the inheritance of Mstislav Yaroslavich the Silent, Daniil handed over Vasilko Lutsk and Peresopnitsa; earlier Vasilko received from his brother Berestye.

{VasilkoizRomanovichei2_desc}Their possessions became separate, but they always acted in harmony, Daniel played the leading role. Sometimes the brothers went camping together; sometimes Daniel sent Vasilko on campaigns or left him to defend Galich, himself going on a campaign. Vasilko played an important role in the Yaroslavl battle, defeating the Poles with his regiment and preventing them from interfering in the battle of Daniel against the Hungarians, in which the fate of the battle was decided. In 1245, Vasilko met with Konrad Mazowiecki with the papal ambassador Plano Karpini. The latter began negotiations on the union of churches. Vasilko called “his bishops”, with whom Plano-Carpini read the messages of the pope. Vasilko, apparently inclined to agreement, did not give a decisive answer, since Daniel left for the Horde. In 1248, Vasilko successfully repulsed the predatory raid of the Yatvyag, overtaking them and destroying 40 Yatvyaz "princes" near Drogochin. When in 1258 the Mongol commander Burundai made the princes need to go with him to Lithuania, it was not Daniil who went (it “will not be good”), but Vasilko. After that, he went to Poland with Burundi. \n
   In 1262, he successfully repelled the predatory raid of Lithuania. The Lithuanians were overtaken near the town of Neblya, pinned to the lake and completely killed by the troops of Vasilka. After the death of Daniel (1264), Vasilko took the first place among the princes: the Poles sent proposals for a congress in Ternov in the war of 1266, he was called by his "father and lord" the Lithuanian prince Voyshelk. However, Vasilko continued to occupy the Volyn throne, and Galich and Lvov inherited Danilovichi. Vasilko died in 1269, transferring possession to his son Vladimir.

   Vsevolod went to Mordovia in 1232, and in 1237 with Prince Ryazan Roman Ingvarich, Vladimir governor Yeremey Glebovich and "all the people" he was sent to meet the Tatars in Kolomna, in the battle with whom he lost the governor, and he himself fled to Vladimir in the "small squad". Here, to meet the Tatars, he was left by his father along with another son of Yuri, Mstislav.

{09Vsevolodiz_Vsevolodovichei3_desc}When the Tatars besieged the city, they invited the Russians to surrender in exchange for preserving the life of the first Prince of Moscow Vladimir Yuryevich, Moscow’s brother Vsevolod and Mstislav, who had been captured by them. When the brothers defending the city refused, the Tatars put Vladimir to death before the Golden Gate. The martyrdom of his brother prompted Vsevolod and Mstislav to persuade the governor Peter and the squad to make a sortie and give an open battle to the Tatars outside Vladimir. This desperate decision was accompanied by the following words: “Brothers, it is better for us to die before the Golden Gate for the Holy Mother of God and for the Orthodox Christian faith.” \n
   Pyotr Oslyadyukovich flatly refused. On February 7, 1238, the Mongols captured the fortifications of the New City. The princes and their families, Bishop Mitrofan moved to the Pechersk city, where Vladyka, along with the princesses, princesses and children, shut himself up in the Assumption Cathedral. The army of Batu began to prevail, and the brothers decided to go out to meet him with gifts. However, according to the chronicler, Batu neglected Vsevolod’s youth: “as a fierce beast did not spare his youth, he ordered to slaughter him and kill the whole city, but the bishop in the church with the princess and children ordered the wicked to light up with fire.”

{11Vladimiriz_Vsevolodovichei_desc}Vladimir Yuryevich - Prince of Moscow since 1236. The youngest son of Grand Duke Vladimir Yuri Vsevolodovich and daughter of Vsevolod Chermny Agafya. \n
   The earliest mention of Vladimir Yurievich dates back to 1228, when he and his elder brother Vsevolod escorted his cousin Vasilk Konstantinovich from Vladimir to Rostov after his wedding with Princess Mary. Perhaps around 1236 Vladimir received from Moscow his father to reign, and then his fate was connected only with this city, which in 1238 was the first of the cities of Northeast Russia to be attacked by the troops of Batu. Mongolian troops as part of their Kipchak campaign after the battle of Kolomna and the departure of Vladimir troops led by Vsevolod Yurievich in Vladimir entered the “Suzdal land” and defeated the detachment of the Ryazan boyar Evpatiy Kolovrat, who had returned from Chernigov, who had attacked their rearguard. On January 15, the Mongols besieged Moscow. This was the first attack by an external enemy in the history of the city. The defense was led by Vladimir Yuryevich and voivode Filipp Nyanka “with a small army”. The city resisted for 5 days. The governor died, and Vladimir was captured.

   Based on the unclear dating of these events in the Jami at-tavarih Rashid al-Din, they attribute the military operations of the Mongols against Bachman to 1237, to the time before the Mongol army invaded Russia. But the Persian historian Juvaini places the story about Bachman separately from the stories about the conquest of the Volga Bulgaria and Russia, therefore it is more likely to attribute the speech of Bachman to 1238-1239, when the Mongols suppressed the uprisings of the Mordovians and Kipchaks. \n
   Against Bachman, the best Mongol forces were sent - the Tumens of Sub-Eday and Munke. According to Juvaini, the Mongols overtook Bachman on one of the Volga islands, having raided 200 ships, each of which had a hundred soldiers of the Mongol forces. The Kipchak army was destroyed, and Bachman was captured and brought to Munke, who, according to the chronicles, began to ask to kill him with his own hands. Munke Khan did not do this, and his brother Buchek executed the captive, chopping him into two. Bachman's name is mentioned in several Nogai legends.

   In 1211, in Galicia, the Hungarian king Andras II, in alliance with the Krakow prince Leszek Bely and the Volyn princes, put Daniil Romanovich, the 10-year-old heir to Roman Galitsky, who died in 1205 at the Battle of Zavikhost, on the Galician prince. But after the Hungarians left, the Galician boyars, led by Vladislav Kormilichich, expelled the Romanovichs together with their regent mother. Then Andras II, in alliance with Leszek, captured Galich in 1214 and put his young son Koloman there, betrothed shortly before with his three-year-old daughter Leshek Salomeya. The western part of the Galician land was received by Leszek Bely. Andras II turned to Pope Innocent III with a request to entrust the Esztergom Archbishop John to crown Coloman with the Galician crown and strengthen his status as a unity of the Galician Orthodox Church with the Catholic Church, which was done (1215). \n
   Soon Peremyshl and Lyubachev were selected by the Hungarians from the Poles, which became a possible reason for Leshek's appeal for help to the Novgorod prince Mstislav Udatny. In the spring of 1215, Mstislav began to threaten the reign of Koloman, about which King Andras reported alarmingly in a letter to Pope Innocent III.

{Koloman_Arpad2_desc}According to various versions, Mstislav first occupied the throne of Galicia already in 1215 (and lost it, returning north to protect Novgorod from the Suzdal princes), or in 1219, taking advantage of the presence of King Andras in 1217-1218 in a crusade in Palestine. Soon after his first arrival in Galich, Mstislav entered into an alliance with Daniil Romanovich Volynsky, giving his daughter Anna for him, Daniel launched military operations against Leszek, he entered into an alliance with the Hungarian king Andras II and moved to Galich with the combined military forces. Despite the successful defense of the city, Daniil Romanovich, who headed it, had to leave the city and break out of the encirclement in battle, as there was no help from Mstislav. In Galich again sat down with a strong garrison Koloman. \n
   In the spring of 1221, Mstislav Udatny again invaded Galicia and defeated the Hungarians at the walls of Galich, capturing the throne of Galicia in 1221. The captive prince Koloman was sent to the city of Torchesk, which belonged to Mstislav. The Hungarian king Andras II, in order to free his son from captivity, was forced to start negotiations. Mstislav made peace with Andras II and married his daughter Maria to his son Andras, known in Russia as “Prince Andrei”. Returning to Hungary, Koloman became the Croatian and Slavonic Duke. \n
   Together with his older brother, he participated in the battle on the Chaillot River with the Mongols on April 11, 1241. He could not recover from his wounds and died in Zagreb in May-June 1241.

   His father, Andras II, took part in the Fifth Crusade and, in returning in 1218, agreed on the marriage of his son Andras with the daughter of Leo II, Isabella (Zabel), the 国王Cilician Armenia. The marriage was to be concluded with the condition that Andras would become the heir to Levon, who had no sons. However, Levon soon died, and for his heiress his son gave Prince Antioch Boemund IV. \n
   After the unsuccessful attempts of King Andras with the help of military force to put his young son Koloman on the Galician throne (defeats of 1215, 1219, 1221), in 1221 he made peace with the captured Galician Prince Mstislav Udatny, who married his daughter Maria "Prince Andrey". \n
   The defeat in the battle on the Kalka River (1223) undermined the forces of the Smolensk princes, and already in 1226 Mstislav handed over to his son-in-law Przemysl, and in 1227 - Galich himself, leaving Ponisier to himself. Then Mstislav planned to organize a joint campaign with Volodymyr’s lands in 1227 and the Polovtsy’s campaign against Andrei, but the death of Mstislav (1228) prevented the implementation of the plans.

   Andrei, with his father and the Galician boyars, went on a campaign against Galich, but Andras retreated due to an epidemic in the army. In 1231, there was a conflict between Daniel and Alexander Belzsky. Taking advantage of this, the boyars surrendered Galich to Andrei of Hungary, who had again come here with an army. Daniel did not give up and, having entered into an alliance with the Kiev prince Vladimir Rurikovich and the Polovtsy, he came to Galich.

   In 1246, Karl was knighted and received the rich appanages of Anjou and Maine, bequeathed to him by his father (provided that a son is born). In 1246, his mother arranged a marriage with Beatrice, the youngest daughter of Raimund (Ramon) Berenguer V, Count of Provence and Vorkalkye. In 1248, Charles went with Louis IX to the Seventh Crusade to Egypt. During his absence in Provence, an uprising broke out. With the help of military force and diplomacy, Karl was able to subdue the rebellious cities by August 1252. In November 1252, Karl's mother, Blanca of Castile, died. Carl was forced to go to Paris, with his brother Alphonse de Poitiers he accepted the regency. At this time, Pope Alexander IV proposed to Charles the crown of the Sicilian kingdom, but Louis IX in his letter forbade Charles to accept the crown. In 1257, he acquired several seignioriums in the Alps from the Dauphin of Vienna, and in addition he received the rights of regent of the Kingdom of Aralatus from the Prince of Orange of Raimund de Bo. In 1258, Count of Ventimiglia recognized himself as a vassal of Charles. In 1259, Karl gained suzerainty over Cuneo, Alba, and Cherasco in southern Piedmont. \n
   At the beginning of 1262, a new revolt broke out in Provence during the absence of Charles, supported by Genoa and the sons of King Aragon Jaime I. The returning Charles agreed with the Genoese, giving them coastal lands, after which he agreed with Marcel through the mediation of King Aragon. As a result, he managed to pacify Provence. Desiring to weaken Hohenstaufen, Pope Urban IV in 1262 proposed the crown of Sicily to Charles of Anjou.

Manfred’s army was defeated, and he himself was killed. By the end of 1266, almost all of Lombardy was in the hands of Karl. In 1267, his troops approached Florence. This caused the flight of the Ghibellines ruling in the Florentine Republic and the rise of radical Guelphs to power. Karl of Anjou was elected as a substitute of Florence. In the fall of 1267, an uprising began in Sicily in support of Conradin. \n
   03.24.1268 Conradin triumphantly entered Rome, and in August, with an enlarged army, he came out to conquer the Sicilian kingdom. Karl, busy subordinating the cities in Tuscany, did not support the Pope in May 1268. At the battle of Tagliacco on 08.23.1268 Konradin’s army was defeated and many of Konradin’s comrades-in-arms were captured. 10.29.1268 Konradin and his friend Friedrich of Baden were publicly beheaded in Naples. This execution left Europe in a state of shock. In 1269, the forces of the Ghibelline communes were defeated at the battle of Colle by the Florentine-French forces. As a result, in Siena, Pisa and other cities of Tuscany, Guelph governments came under power, controlled by Carl of Anjou. After the death of Pope Clement IV (11.28.1268), Rome came under the control of Charles, and by the end of 1270 he subjugated all of Tuscany. In the spring of the same year, Karl was able to suppress the uprising in Sicily. Needing money, Karl of Anjou imposed a high tax on the kingdom. All this caused displeasure of the population.

He defeated the Tunisian army, after which Al-Mustansir made peace on conditions favorable to Karl. In feb. 1272 Karl proclaimed himself 国王Albania. \n
   10/15/1273 the marriage between Philippe de Courtenay and Beatrice of Anjou was celebrated. A few days later, Emperor Baldwin II died and the title of "Emperor of Constantinople" was recognized for Carl's son-in-law, Philip. In 1275, the Pope secured a friendship treaty between the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph I of Habsburg and Karl, who was sealed by the marriage of Karl's elder grandson, Karl Martel, and Rudolph's daughter, Clementia. 01/15/1277 Charles I of Anjou received rights to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in exchange for a life annuity to his heiress, Mary of Antioch. The vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, under the threat of exile, brought Carl Anjou a homage. In May 1280, Karl refused to governor in Tuscany, and the Kingdom of Aralat in the future was to go to his grandson Karl Martel. After the death of Pope Nicholas III (08.22.1280), Martin IV became the new Pope. Carl tried to take advantage of the Pope’s location to capture Piedmont, but in May 1281 he was defeated by the Margrave of Saluzzo in the Borgo San Dalmazo. His attempts to maintain control of Lombardy and the campaign against Constantinople also failed.

{Charles1_dAnjou4_desc}Pedro III supported the exiles who plotted against Charles. Dissatisfied Sicilians rallied around Count Giovanni Procida. The uprising began on Easter 30.03.1282. In one day, about 2,000 Frenchmen were cut to Palermo, and the city came under the control of the rebels. This event is called "Sicilian Vespers". Following the example of Palermo, uprisings began in other cities. In Messina, where Karl's fleet and strong garrison were located, most of the French managed to take refuge in the citadel, but the fleet was burned. At the call of the Sicilians, Pedro of Aragon, at the head of a huge army, landed in Trapani on 08/30/1282, was crowned in Palermo as 国王Sicily on 4/09/1282, and soon took control of the entire island. The loss of Sicily, the former food base of the kingdom, was an unpleasant surprise for Karl of Anjou. He began to prepare for war with Aragon. Karl of Anjou managed to gather an impressive army in Provence: 22 thousand horsemen, 60 thousand infantry and about 200 warships with crews. But military happiness was on the side of the Aragonese and Sicilians. In June 1284, the Sicilians, led by Ruggiero de Lauria, by feigned retreat lured the fleet of Anjou from the Naples harbor and completely defeated it. Karl Salernsky was captured and was saved from execution only by the intervention of Constance, the wife of Pedro III. \n
   Karl, Count of Anjou, was a man of high stature, strong physique, and had a royal posture. His swarthy face was stern, his look gloomy and scary. He almost never laughed. Karl was very devout. He was a brave knight, distinguished by prudence, restraint, firmness, insight. But along with this he was power-hungry, greedy and cruel.

Friedrich recognized Manfred as his legitimate son only in the dying minutes and left him the Tarents bishopric and government until the arrival of his half-brother, Conrad IV. At first the brothers were very friendly, but then Conrad became 害怕:influence that Manfred had in Italy. He took control of Tarentus, took the highest judicial power from Manfred and set heavy taxes everywhere in favor of his treasury. However, Manfred continued to remain faithful to Conrad after that. After the death of Conrad IV from malaria in 1254, Manfred was elected regent of the Sicilian kingdom. \n
   Since Pope Innocent IV refused to recognize the right of inheritance for Hohenstaufen, Manfred fled to the Saracens in Lucerne. On December 2, 1254, at the Battle of Foggia, he defeated papal forces led by the legate Guillermo Fieschi, which allowed him to conquer Capua, Naples, Aversa and Brindisi, and then cross to Sicily.

{Manfred1_vonHohenstaufen2_desc}Based on a false rumor about the death of Conradin, he entrusted the royal crown in 1258, but as soon as the messengers arrived from Conradin, he recognized his inheritance rights. Living in Palermo, Manfred patronized poets and scientists. Not embarrassed by the curse of the pope, he helped the exiled Florentine Ghibellines, who, with his assistance, won the victory at Montaperti (September 4, 1260); thus he gained power over Florence and almost all of Tuscany. \n
   In 1259, Manfred supported the despot Epirus Michael II Comnenus Dooku and Prince Morea Guillaume II de Villardouin in conflict with the Nicene Empire. Not embarrassed by the curse on the part of the papal curia, he helped the expelled Florentine gibellins, who, with his assistance, defeated Montaperti (September 4, 1260); thus he gained power over Florence and almost all of Tuscany. Having betrayed in 1262 his daughter from his first marriage, Constanta, for Pedro of Aragon, he secured himself protection in the West; marrying for the second time to Helen, sister of the emperor tsar Michael II, he showed that in the East he would follow the Norman-Hohenstaufen policy. Manfred’s increased power aroused the displeasure of Conradin’s adherents in Germany and forced Pope Urban IV to conclude an agreement with Karl of Anjou, who invaded southern Italy in 1266. In the battle of Benevento (February 26, 1266), the Germans were defeated; Manfred sought death and found it.

{GediminasLith}传记 (1st part)
{GediminasLith_desc}Gediminas (c. 1275) - Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1316 to 1341, founder of the Gediminovich dynasty. His name is the most famous historical monument of Lithuania - Gediminas' Tower in Vilnius. \n
   It is known that Gediminus initially ruled the castle in the land of Pagraude near Quedarna and Šilale, where some researchers localize his patrimony. Gediminus waged a fierce battle with the German knights, inflicted a number of defeats on them. In 1322 he entered into an alliance with the Prince of Mazovia, and in 1325 with the Polish king Vladislav Lokotk, having sealed the latter, betraying his daughter Aldon, married to the son of Vladislav, Casimir. \n
   Like his predecessors, Gediminas continued the annexation of West Russian lands. Old Russian lands peacefully passed under his authority with the cities of Polotsk (1307), Grodno (according to another version the city was annexed earlier) and Berestye (1315), Vitebsk (1320), Minsk (1326), Turov and Pinsk (1336) and others. The vassals of Gediminas became the Minsk, Lukomsky, Drutsky, Beresteysky, Drogichin princes. In addition, he had a great influence in Zemaitiya, which was not part of the state of Gediminas, having a strong tradition of autonomy. Since 1340, in Volyn his son Lubart reigned, son-in-law of the last Volyn prince from the Romanovich dynasty.
{GediminasLith_effects_desc}..

{GediminasLith2}传记 (2nd part)
{GediminasLith2_desc}Later tradition considers Gedimin to be the founder of the capital in Vilnius (modern Vilnius), which was first mentioned in his letters: no later than 1323 he laid down a wooden castle at the confluence of Vilnius in Vilnius (Neris) and moved his residence to Vilnius, thus becoming the capital of the Great Principality of Lithuania. In letters to Pope John XXII, Hanseatic cities, Franciscans and Dominicans (1323-1324) he declared his desire to accept the Christian faith and invited knights, artisans, merchants, farmers, priests to Lithuania. Gedimin was the second after Mindovg to call himself king ("国王Lithuanians and Russians"). Of the seven sons of Gediminas, five were Christians, all of his daughters were also married to Christians. \n
   Gediminus fought against the Principality of Moscow and Prince Ivan Kalita for influence in Pskov and Novgorod. In this struggle, he relied on an alliance with Tver, sealed by the marriage of the daughter of Gediminas Maria with Prince Dmitry Mikhailovich the Terrible Ochi (1320). \n
   Gediminas moved to Russia in 1324. Having occupied Ovruch and Zhytomyr, he ran into a coalition of the Kiev, Pereyaslav, Chernihiv and Bryansk princes under the general command of Stanislav of Kiev. The coalition was defeated, and Gedimin occupied Kiev. The principle of government under Gediminas was: "Do not destroy antiquities, do not introduce novelty." This meant a respectful attitude to the lands of the feudal lords and the preservation of the historical traditions of the population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, continuity in political and public life.

{OsmanIGazi}传记 (1st part)
{OsmanIGazi_desc}The first Turkish sultan, Osman I, at the age of 23, inherited vast territories in Phrygia from his father, Prince Ertogrul. He combined the scattered Turkish tribes with the Muslims fleeing the Mongols, later they all became known as the Ottomans, and conquered a significant part of the Byzantine state, gaining access to the Black and Marmara Seas. In 1299, he founded an empire named after him. Having captured the Byzantine city of Yenisehir in 1301, Osman made it the capital of his empire. In 1326, he stormed the city of Bursa, which already under his son Orhan became the second capital of the empire. \n
   The territory in Asia Minor, on which Turkey is located today, in ancient times was called Anatolia and was the cradle of many civilizations. Among them, one of the most developed was the Byzantine Empire - a Greco-Roman Orthodox state with a capital in Constantinople. Created in 1299 by the Sultan Osman, the Ottoman Empire actively expanded its borders and seized neighboring lands. Gradually, under his rule were many provinces of the weakening Byzantium. \n
   The reasons for the victories of the Sultan Osman were, first of all, in his ideology; he declared war on the Christians and intended to seize their lands and enrich his subjects. Many Muslims flocked under his banners, including Turkic nomads and artisans who fled from the invasion of the Mongols, were not Muslims. The Sultan accepted everyone. He first formed the army of Janissaries - the future regular Turkish infantry, created from Christians, slaves and prisoners, later it was replenished with children of Christians raised in Islamic traditions.
{OsmanIGazi_effects_desc}..

{OsmanIGazi2}传记 (2nd part)
{OsmanIGazi2_desc}Osman’s authority was so high that poems and songs began to be composed in his honor during his lifetime. Many scholars of that time - dervishes - pointed to the prophetic meaning of his name, which, according to one source, meant "beating the bones," that is, a warrior who knew no obstacles and knocked the enemy down, and for others, the "vulture hawk" that feeds carrion of the slain. But in the West, Christians did not call him Ottoman, but Ottoman, which simply meant "Ottoman Turks." \n
   The widespread offensive of Osman, his well-armed army, led to the fact that the Byzantine peasants, whom no one defended, were forced to flee, abandoning their well-cultivated agricultural areas. And the Turks got pastures, vineyards, orchards. The tragedy of Byzantium was that its capital, Constantinople, was captured in 1204 by the Crusader knights who made the Fourth Crusade. The completely looted city became the capital of the Latin Empire, which disintegrated by 1261. Byzantium was again created at the same time, but already weakened and unable to resist the external invasion.

{OsmanIGazi3}传记 (3rd part)
{OsmanIGazi3_desc}The Byzantines focused their efforts on creating a fleet, they wanted to stop the Turks by the sea, not to allow them to advance deep into the mainland. But nothing could stop Osman. In 1301, his army inflicted a crushing defeat on the joint Byzantine forces near Nicaea (now the Turkish city of Iznik). In 1304, the sultan captured the city of Ephesus on the Aegean Sea - the center of early Christianity, in which, according to legend, the apostle Paul lived, wrote the Gospel of John. The Turks sought to Constantinople, to the Bosphorus. \n
   The last conquest of Osman was the Byzantine city of Bursa. This victory was very important - it opened the way to Constantinople. The sultan who was near death ordered his subjects to turn Bursa into the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Osman did not live to see the fall of Constantinople. But other sultans continued his work and created the great Ottoman Empire, which lasted until 1922.

{Yaroslav_TverskoyVlad}传记 (1st part)
{Yaroslav_TverskoyVlad_desc}Yaroslav Yaroslavich - the first independent prince of Tver (since 1247), the great prince of Vladimir since 1263. The son of the Grand Duke of Vladimir Yaroslav Vsevolodovich. \n
   During Nevyruyev’s ratification (1252), Yaroslav was an ally of Andrei, the Tver regiment, led by the governor Zhiroslav, was in the army of Andrei, and after the victory of the Tatars in Pereyaslavl-Zalessky, they killed his wife Yaroslav and captured the children. In 1254, Yaroslav was received in Ladoga, and in 1255 in Novgorod, from where the son of Alexander Nevsky was expelled, Vasily to Torzhok, Yaroslav was transferred to Pskov, and then to Novgorod. Alexander Nevsky opposed Yaroslav, who was forced to leave Novgorod. In 1258, Yaroslav, along with his brothers and nephew Boris Vasilkovich Rostov, traveled to the Horde, from where, according to the annals, he was released “with great honor” and returned to Tver. \n
   In 1262, Yaroslav participated in a joint Russian-Lithuanian campaign against Derpt belonging to the Livonian Order. In 1263, after the death of Alexander Nevsky, the khan passed the grand-ducal label to his younger brother Yaroslav, who was apparently regarded as more loyal than the oldest at that time Andrei. Under the rule of Yaroslav were the Tver and Vladimir principalities. According to the version of I.E. Zabelin, according to a spiritual testament, Alexander Yaroslavich Nevsky gave Moscow to his youngest son, two-year-old Daniel, who had been under the care of Yaroslav for seven years with Moscow. In 1266, the Novgorodians (under the influence of the smaller party), having expelled Pereyaslavl Prince Dmitry Alexandrovich, again invited Yaroslav to reign, who married the daughter of Novgorod boyar Yuri Mikhailovich, probably with the aim of strengthening his position in Novgorod.
{Yaroslav_TverskoyVlad_effects_desc}..

{Yaroslav_TverskoyVlad2}传记 (2nd part)
{Yaroslav_TverskoyVlad2_desc}But the very next year, Yaroslav Yaroslavich left Novgorod, leaving his nephew Dmitry Alexandrovich there. The positions of the prince and the boyars diverged on the attitude towards the part of the Lithuanian nobility who fled from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to Pskov, headed by Prince Dovmont after the end of the feud, caused by the violent death of Mindovg and ended with the coming to power of Troiden. In 1268, Yaroslav, at the request of the Novgorodians, sent their sons (Svyatoslav and Michael) and other princes to help them, who participated in the Battle of Rakovors against the Knights of the Livonian Order. \n
   In 1270, Yaroslav was driven out by the Novgorodians and decided to pacify Novgorod, calling for the participation in the future struggle of the princes Dmitry Alexandrovich Pereyaslavsky and Gleb Rostislavich Smolensky and enlisting help from the Horde. The side of the Novgorodians was taken by the brother of Yaroslav, Vasily Yaroslavich, the prince of Kostroma, whom the Horde diplomats decided to oppose to Yaroslav. For a week the opponents stood against each other at Old Russia, but in the end, Yaroslav reconciled with the Novgorodians with the assistance of Metropolitan of Kiev and All Russia Kirill III; both sides agreed to mutual concessions. Departing from Novgorod, Yaroslav left there governor of the boyar Andrei Vorotislavich.

   In 1262, Dmitry Alexandrovich, together with his uncle Yaroslav Yaroslavich, was sent by his father against the Livonian knights to Yuryev, took the city and returned with rich booty. Immediately after the death of Alexander Nevsky (1263), the Novgorodians expelled Dmitry Alexandrovich, and he left for Pereyaslavl-Zalessky. In 1269, the Novgorodians, embarking on a war with the Livonians, invited him to help, and Dmitry Alexandrovich played a key role in defeating the Germans. A year later, the Novgorodians, in gratitude, offered Dmitry Alexandrovich their table, having driven Yaroslav away, but Dmitry Alexandrovich refused and sat down in Novgorod to live after the death of his uncle 2 years later. However, his other uncle, Vasily Yaroslavich, gathered the army and, together with other princes, began to devastate Novgorod possessions. Dmitry Alexandrovich opposed him and reached Torzhok when he suddenly found out that the Novgorodians had changed their minds and, fearing the wrath of the great prince, decided to get rid of the Pereyaslavsky prince. Dmitry Alexandrovich then himself refused the Novgorod reign and went to his inheritance. When Vasily Yaroslavich died (1276), Dmitry Alexandrovich, as the eldest of his kind, took the throne in Vladimir, and in May of the following year, arriving in Novgorod, he was recognized there as a prince.

{DmitriiAleksandrovich_Novg2_desc}In 1278, as the prince of Novgorod, he went to pacify the rebellious Korela and ravaged its lands; built (with the permission of the Novgorodians) Koporye fortress. In 1281, his brother, the specific Gorodets prince Andrei Alexandrovich, went to the Horde and slandered Dmitry Alexandrovich in front of the khan, begging himself a label for the great reign and auxiliary Tatar army, and then moved to Pereyaslavl. Dmitry Alexandrovich fled to Koporye, but the Novgorodians forced him to withdraw the garrison from Koporye, after which they tore down the fortress to the base, deprived Dmitry Alexandrovich of the throne of Novgorod and imprisoned Andrei. Dmitry Alexandrovich went to Pereyaslavl, where he began to collect troops for the war with his brother, but Muscovites, Tverichs and Novgorodians opposed him. \n
   However, Dmitry Alexandrovich, abandoning the throne of Novgorod, remained the Grand Duke. Andrei did not like this, and he again called on the Tatars. Dmitry Alexandrovich fled to Nogai, who received Dmitry Alexandrovich very well and forced Andrei to return his illegally seized great throne to his brother. Dmitry Alexandrovich returned (1283) to Russia, reconciled with his brother, but cruelly avenged his boyars and supporters. Novgorod also recognized him as his prince. Andrei, however, after 2 years invited the Tatar prince to his place, who, having come to Russia with a large army, began to rob and burn all cities and villages in a row.

Khan did not really begin to punish the masterful Russian, obviously 害怕:Nogai's intercession for him. After this, for the whole 7 years, Dmitry Alexandrovich quietly sat on the great throne, while Andrei, united with some unhappy princes, went to Nogai (1292). He denigrated Dmitry Alexandrovich in the eyes of Nogai. As a result, Prince Duden moved towards the Grand Duke with a huge army. Dmitry Alexandrovich, learning about this, fled from Pereyaslavl to Pskov to Dovmont. The Tatars devastated many cities and villages and left with a huge crowd in the Horde, and Andrew took the great throne and was immediately declared the Prince of Novgorod. The plot of Dmitry Alexandrovich - Pereyaslavl-Zalessky - Andrei transferred to one of his allies - Prince Smolensk Fyodor Rostislavich Chernoy, but Dmitry Alexandrovich, having learned about Duden's departure, decided to return to Pereyaslavl, but he was almost intercepted by Torzhok and was barely saved, leaving in his hands the enemy the whole convoy. This time he fled to Tver. The young Tver prince Mikhail Yaroslavich received Dmitry Alexandrovich and agreed to become an intermediary between the brothers. With the help of the Tver bishop, he managed to reconcile them. \n
   Dmitry Alexandrovich refused the great reign in favor of his brother, but left Pereyaslavl-Zalessky to himself. Dmitry Alexandrovich at the end of 1293 went to Pereyaslavl, but along the way, near Volok, he fell ill and soon died.

{AndronikosII_Paleolog}传记 (1st part)
{AndronikosII_Paleolog_desc}Andronic II Paleologue (March 25, 1259) - 皇帝Byzantine Empire in 1282-1328 Andronicus II Palaeologist was born in the family of the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaeologist and Theodora Dukina Vatats, granddaughter of John III Duca Vatats, Emperor Nicaea. From the age of 13 (1272) he was the co-ruler of his father; It is known that in 1280, Emperor Michael VIII sent his son along with Protestorate Michael Tarkhaniot and the great seal keeper Nostong in the Meander River region to restore the city of Thrall. The young co-ruler of his father actively took up the matter, built walls and moved many people to the city. In the same 1280, Andronic II declared his three-year-old son Michael IX Paleolog as a formal co-ruler of Basileus. \n
   Michael VIII died on December 11, 1282 during a military campaign in Thrace and Andronicus II became the ruler of Byzantium. At the end of 1282, he abolished the church union introduced by his father Michael VIII with the western (Roman Catholic) church. He pursued a policy of accession to Byzantium of Thessaly, Epirus, separated after the fourth crusade (1204). Andronicus II continued his father’s policy of supporting the Byzantine-Mongolian alliance. However, he failed to maintain peaceful relations with the nomads, and at the end of his reign, the Mongol raids on the Balkan possessions of the empire continued.
{AndronikosII_Paleolog_effects_desc}..

{AndronikosII_Paleolog2}传记 (2nd part)
{AndronikosII_Paleolog2_desc}May 21, 1294 in the church of St. Sophia in Constantinople, Patriarch John XII crowned Michael IX to the kingdom, and in subsequent years, Andronicus entrusted his co-ruler son with waging wars against internal and external enemies. Andronicus II unsuccessfully intervened in the struggle between Venice and Genoa, which led at the beginning of the 14th century to an increase in the dominance of the Venetians in the empire. In an effort to repulse the strong Turkish army (by which time it had seized almost the whole of Asia Minor), in 1303 he hired an army of Catalans led by Roger de Flor, who, after the assassination of their commander-in-chief in 1305, rebelled, devastated Byzantine possessions, occupied Thessaly and several others Byzantine areas. \n
   In 1320, the grandson of Andronic II Andronic III hires killers who mistakenly kill his sister Anna and brother Manuel. Upon learning of this, their father Michael IX died of grief on October 12 and Andronic II became the sovereign ruler. The actions of the centralized Andronik government provoked resistance from the feudal nobility, who advanced his grandson to the throne in 1321 and the Civil War broke out in Byzantium. On November 11, 1323 he placed his close monk Isaiah on the Patriarchal throne. Historians believe that Isaiah suited the ruling circles of Byzantium, since he was probably considered incapable of independent political activity and easily controlled.

{AndronikosII_Paleolog3_desc}In 1326, he tried to renew the contacts of the Constantinople and Roman Catholic Churches. To this end, he sent messages to Pope John XXII and King Charles IV of France with a proposal to resume negotiations on a union. Patriarch Isaiah opposed the implementation of such plans, which soon led to a freeze in relations. \n
   In 1327, Andronicus III besieged Constantinople and Andronicus II ordered Isaiah to stop commemorating the name of Andronicus III in the liturgy as a rebel. But Isaiah refused to obey this order, trying to avoid a church schism from drawing the Church into civil strife and, with a large crowd of people, announced the excommunication of anyone who would not remember Andronicus III. As a result, the order of Andronicus II was valid only in the palace temples of the capital, while all the other churches continued to commemorate both Andronicus. Isaiah facilitated reconciliation of the parties and persuaded Andronicus II to go on a personal meeting with his grandson and thereby begin peace negotiations, but to no avail. In December 1327, another attempt to negotiate failed and Andronicus II sent Isaiah from the Patriarchal residence and to the capital’s monastery Mangany, some of the supporters and close patriarch were taken into custody. In May 1328, Andronicus III won a series of victories in the internecine war and took Constantinople, and Isaiah was solemnly returned to the Patriarchal throne.

The son of Jaime I the Conqueror, 国王Aragon, Valencia and Mallorca, Count of Barcelona, ​​and his second wife, Yolanda of Hungary. \n
   In his youth, Pedro took part in his father’s wars against the Moors of al-Andalus. On June 13, 1262, Pedro married Constance, the daughter of the Sicilian king Manfred Staufen. In 1276 he succeeded his father in Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia. In November 1276, Pedro III was crowned in Zaragoza, refusing to take a vassal oath to his father (his grandfather Pedro II and father Jaime I were vassals of the Holy See) and thereby laying the seeds of conflict with the papacy. The first years of the reign of Pedro III was forced to fight with dissatisfied vassals. In 1277, the Tunisian 哈里发Abu Yusuf Yakub refused to take a vassal oath. Pedro III sent a military expedition to Tunisia in 1280, and in 1281–1282 the king gathered a fleet of 140 ships to personally punish the ruler from the Hafsid dynasty. In 1282, Pedro III took the Algerian city of Alcoil and turned it into a base for the further conquest of North Africa. But the uprising that began in Sicily against Charles I of Anjou (Sicilian Vespers) forced Pedro III to change his plans. The inhabitants of Sicily, conquered by Charles I of Anjou in 1266, have long been dissatisfied with the occupying French regime. March 29, 1282 in Palermo, an uprising against the French began - the Sicilian Vespers. An uprising soon swept the whole island, the French were killed.

{PedroIIIde_Aragon2_desc}Charles I of Anjou, who was about to start a war against Byzantium, was forced to change plans and landed in Messina, besieging it from the sea and land. The rebels sent a delegation to Alcoil, begging Pedro III to accept the crown of Sicily and protect it from Charles I of Anjou. Pedro III, apparently ready for such a turn of events, agreed. On August 30, 1282 he landed in Trapani, on the way to Palermo, the Sicilians welcomed him, and already on September 4, 1282 he was crowned in Palermo as 国王Sicily (Pedro I). On November 18, 1282, Pope Martin IV, pro-French unlike Nicholas III, excommunicated Pedro III from the Church. The new Byzantine emperor Andronicus II Palaeologist fell under the anathema too, together with his father invisibly standing behind the Sicilian events, which meant the end of the short-lived Union of Lyons. In September - October 1282 Pedro took control of all of Sicily, and Charles I of Anjou was forced to lift the siege from Messina and sail to the continent. \n
   In the following months, the Sicilian fleet under the command of Ruggiero di Lauria defeated the Neapolitans several times, and by February 1283 Pedro III occupied a significant part of the coast of Calabria. Charles I of Anjou was forced to leave Naples and go to Provence to gather new fleet and army there. The viceroy of Charles in Naples remained his son - the future Charles II. In June 1284, the Sicilians, led by Roger de Loria, feigned retreat lured the Neapolitan fleet from Salerno and completely defeated it. The future Charles II was captured and was saved from execution only by the intervention of Constance, the wife of Pedro III. Pedro himself was at that time in Aragon, where he encountered unprecedented resistance from the nobility.

{PedroIIIde_Aragon3}传记 (3rd part)
{PedroIIIde_Aragon3_desc}The conflict with Charles I of Anjou and the impending war with France forced Pedro III to convene the Cortes in Tarragona in 1283 in order to gain the support of the nobility and cities. Instead, the Cortes accused the 国王imprudently launching a risky war and burdening the country with illegal exactions. Representatives of the nobility and cities formed Unia - an alliance for the protection of traditional liberties - Fueros. The new Cortes in Zaragoza again demanded confirmation from the 国王the Fueros. The result of the Cortes in Zaragoza was the signing of Pedro III Privilegio General - General Privileges. This document was fundamental to Aragon during the next four reigns, right up to the reign of Pedro IV Ceremonial. By general privileges the power of Khustisya, a mediating judge between the king and Unia, was strengthened. On all controversial issues, the Khustis decision was binding. The king undertook to convene the Cortes at least once a year and consult with them on all current matters. Representatives of all three classes were introduced into the royal council; without the approval of this council, the king could neither declare war nor conclude peace. All taxes imposed by Pedro III were abolished, the introduction of new taxes without the consent of the council and the Cortes was not allowed. \n
   The excommunication of Pedro III from the Church automatically made him an outcast among European monarchs and freed his subjects from the oath. The first to be heard was the brother of Pedro III - Jaime II (国王Mallorca). In 1283, he recognized the French King Philip III the Bold as the lord of the county of Montpellier, and also allowed the French army and navy free passage through Roussillon.

{PedroIIIde_Aragon4_desc}In May 1284, Pope Martin IV announced the deposition of Pedro III and granted the Aragonese crown to Carl Valois, the second son of Philip III of France (Carl Valois was his mother Isabella of Aragon nephew Pedro III). Since Pedro III was not going to obey the verdict of the pope and did not refuse from the Aragonese and Sicilian crowns, Martin IV announced a crusade against the king. In 1284, the army of Philip III and Carl Valois, having crossed Roussillon and crossed the Pyrenees, invaded Catalonia. In 1285, after a long siege, the French captured Gerona - the first major city of Catalonia. Here, the papal legate crowned Carl Valois as 国王Aragon. Since not all vassals supported Pedro III, his position was critical. But soon the course of the war changed: the Sicilian fleet under the command of Roger de Loria defeated the French, which deprived Philip III of the opportunity to receive reinforcements and food from France, and an epidemic of dysentery began in the camp of the French army itself. The French asked Pedro III for a truce in order to be able to retreat behind the Pyrenees. But Pedro III refused a truce and ambushed the enemies at the Panissar pass, in which the French were defeated. \n
   On October 5, 1285, Philip III died in Perpignan, his son Philip IV the Beautiful preferred to cease hostilities. Now Pedro III crossed the Pyrenees and occupied Roussillon, his brother Jaime II of Mallorca again recognized himself as a vassal of Aragon and, fearing his brother, fled under the protection of the French to Narbonne.

In 1249, together with his brother Baldwin, he commanded the crusaders from Cyprus during the siege of Damietta. \n
   According to the medieval historian Jean de Joinville, he was one of the most experienced knights of his time and a good ruler of Cyprus.

{Jeann_Ibelin}传记 (1st part)
{Jeann_Ibelin_desc}Jean Ibelin is Count of Jaffa and Ascalon, a well-known jurist and author of the longest legal treatise in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The son of Philip Ibelin, a bailiff of the Kingdom of Cyprus, and Alice Montbeliard, the nephew of Jean Ibelin, "The Old Senior Beirut." To distinguish him from his uncle and other members of the Ibelin family by the name of Jean, he is sometimes called Jean of Jaffa. \n
   His family was the first Ibelin branch to settle in Cyprus, as his father was regent of the kingdom in 1218–1227. In 1229, Jean fled from Cyprus with his family when Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, seized the Ibelin possessions on the island. They temporarily settled in North Palestine, where their dynasty also had possessions. Jean participated in the Battle of Casal Imbert, where his uncle Jean Beirutsky defeated Riccardo Filanieri, commandant of Frederick in the east. Around 1240, he married Maria Barbaron, sister of the 国王Cilicia, Getum I, and sister-in-law of Henry I, 国王Cyprus. In 1241, he was probably responsible for developing a compromise between the Ibelins and the emperor, according to which Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, was to rule the kingdom. This proposal was not implemented and Simon never arrived in the Holy Land. The Ibelins continued to quarrel with the Hohenstaufen, and in 1242 they captured Tyr from their rivals. Jean also participated in the siege. Shortly afterwards, somewhere between 1246 and the beginning of the Seventh Crusade, Jean became Earl of Jaffa and Ascalon and lord Ramla.
{Jeann_Ibelin_effects_desc}..

{Jeann_Ibelin2}传记 (2nd part)
{Jeann_Ibelin2_desc}Ramla was the old possession of the Ibelins, but Jaffa and Ascalon belonged to other dynasties, and more specifically, the more recently murdered Gautier IV of Brienne, whose son Jean, Count Brienne (nephew of King Henry II) was ousted by Ibelins from his possessions. This probably happened when King Henry, a cousin of Jean, became regent of Jerusalem and began to distribute land on the continent to the Cypriot barons to create a base of loyal people there. Jaffa was by then a small port, and Ascalon was captured by the Mamelukes from the hospitaliers in 1247. In 1249, Jean joined the Seventh Crusade and participated in the capture of Dumyat by Louis IX. Louis was captured when the city was recaptured by Muslims, but Jean probably escaped the same fate. Louis was released in 1252 and then moved his troops to Jaffa. \n
   The constable and chronicler of Louis Jean de Joinville portrays Jean in a favorable light: he describes the coat of arms of Jean as “a pleasant thing to the eye ... or a coat of arms with a patee gules cross”. Jean by that time had become a very famous lord in the east. He corresponded with Henry III and Pope Innocent IV, who confirmed the gift of possessions to Henry I Jean. Henry I died in 1253. Louis IX returned to France in 1254, leaving Jean as the bailiff of Jerusalem. Jean made peace with Damascus and gathered the forces of the kingdom to attack Ascalon. In response, the Egyptians launched a siege of Jaffa in 1256.

{Jeann_Ibelin3}传记 (3rd part)
{Jeann_Ibelin3_desc}John moved to help the city and won, after which he abandoned the bailiwick in favor of his cousin Jean Arsufsky. Meanwhile, between the trading communities of the Genoese and the Venetians living in Acre, a conflict broke out, which went down in history under the name “War of Saint Sava”. Jean supported the Venetians. In order to restore order in the kingdom, Jean and Boehmund of Antioch called on the Dowager Queen of Cyprus, Pleasantia of Antioch to accept the regency under King Conradine, a minor and in Italy. The Venetians, however, defeated the Genoese in a naval battle in 1258 and after that the Genoese left Acre. After the arrival of Pleasantia and her son Hugo II in Acre, the influence of the Ibelin house began to decline. \n
   Around 1263, however, Jean entered into a controversial affair with Pleasantry, which probably prompted Urban IV to send an official letter denouncing their relationship, De sinu patris. Jean's wife and his children are supposed to have lived separately from him at this time. Maria visited her family in Cilicia in 1256 and 1263, and died after visiting her father, Constantine Baberon, who was at death, on his own deathbed. John could do little while Baybars I, the Sultan of Egypt, fought with the Mongols in Palestine. Jaffa probably fell into vassal dependence before Baybars, and he used the city port to send food to Egypt.

{Julienne_deGranie}传记 (1st part)
{Julienne_deGranie_desc}Julien de Granier - Senior Sidon in 1247-1260, later - titular. The son and heir to Balian I de Granier and Margarita de Reinel (daughters of Arno de Reinel and Ida de Brienne, younger sister of John de Brienne). Known in French historiography as "a heavy baron with a light head." \n
   In 1252, Julien married Euphemia (d. 1309), the daughter of the 国王Lesser Armenia, Hetum I, with whom he later divorced. They had three children - Balian II (d. 1277), Jean (d. 1289) and Margarita (became the wife of Guy II Embriako). From 1256 to 1261 he had a relationship with the widow of the Cypriot king Henry I, Pleasantia of Antioch, which caused papal anger and the demand to get married. Julien made a fortune thanks to his marriage to Euphemia, but he soon became mired in debt, which was facilitated by a gambling loss. In 1254, he was forced to sell Casal-Robert to hospitals, in 1256-1257 - Shuf, Gesen and the Grotto of Tyrone to the Teutons (for 23 thousand bezants), then - three estates near Sidon (for 5 thousand bezants). In 1255, Julien gave land in the coastal village of Damur to the emir Jamal ad-Din from the Beirut region.

{Julienne_deGranie2}传记 (2nd part)
{Julienne_deGranie2_desc}In 1258–1260, Julien fought against his uncle Philip de Montfort (French), Señor Tire (War of Saint Sava). In 1260, when the Mongols defeated the Syrian emirs, Julien, according to J. Richard, "saw in the disaster that befell Syria, only one more opportunity to rob." From Beaufort Castle, he attacked Marg Aiyun and captured rich booty. The nephew of the Mongol commander Kitbuki rushed after him, but was destroyed along with his small detachment. In response, Kitbook besieged Sidon. Julien bravely fought in front of the city to enable the population to escape, and then took refuge in a naval stronghold. The Mongols looted the lower city, demolished the walls, but did not attack the castles. After this, the Sidon lord sold all his fief with Sidon and Beaufort to the Templars, without asking the king’s permission. However, due to the plight of Julien, the king forgave him, only obliging him to put up several knights in the service. \n
   Having lost his possessions, Julien joined the Templars, and then left the order, becoming a Trinitarian, in which capacity and died in 1275.

{Berke_Khan}传记 (1st part)
{Berke_Khan_desc}Grandson of Genghis Khan. The third son of Khan Jochi. In 1229, the young prince Berke, like other Genghisides, took part in the kurultai, at which Ugadei was proclaimed the great khan. He participated in the Western Campaign, where he commanded one of the large detachments of the Mongolian army. Resolutely pressed Kipchak detachments. When in 1242, after the end of the invasion of Eastern Europe, Batu Khan returned to the lower Volga, Berke received one of the parts of the Dzhuchi ulus that covered the North Caucasian steppes. He received good income税收 routes stretching from Iran and Asia Minor through Derbent. In 1254, Batu Khan, taking these possessions under his authority, ordered Burke to move his headquarters east of the Volga. In 1246, Berke, along with his other brothers, represented Batu (evading participation) in the kurultai, when Guyuk was elected great khan. Five years later, Batu ordered Burke and Sartak to advance with three tumens to Mongolia to support Munke, whom Batu proposed to nominate to the great khans. On July 1, 1251, the forces of the Golden Horde, not allowing them to oppose the disagreeing from the uluses of Chagatai and Ogedei, ensured the election of Munke. \n
   Berke became the ruler of the Golden Horde in 1257, after Sartak (son) and Ulagchi (grandson) of Batu died one after the other. Having ascended the throne, Berke, assigned to all the elder and younger brothers those destinies that were given to them in the possession of Batu. The Bulgars and Mordovians established a central administration to replace the existing local administrations. Bashkiria maintained autonomy, led by the local dynasty of rulers. In Russia, and in other countries subject to the Horde, by order of the great Khan Munke, a general population census was organized to more correctly recruit soldiers and collect taxes.
{Berke_Khan_effects_desc}..

{Berke_Khan2}传记 (2nd part)
{Berke_Khan2_desc}In the early years of his throne, Berke Khan paid special attention to South Russian affairs. The Galician Prince Daniil Romanovich, who sought to gain independence from the Horde, acted quite successfully. As early as about 1256, he expelled the Mongolian troops from Northern Podolia, the Bolokhov land and Eastern Volhynia. The Horde commander Kurumishi could not resist him, namely, the attempts to storm Vladimir-Volynsky and Lutsk ended in failure. In 1258, Berke appointed an active Burundai instead of Kurumishi in the Dnieper Ulus, supplying him with a large army. \n
   Burundi correctly used the disagreements between Daniel and his former ally, the Grand Duke of Lithuania Mindovg. In the same year, the Mongol military commander undertook a campaign against Lithuania, demanding that Daniil join him with his army. The Galician prince, fearing the insidiousness of the Mongols, sent his brother Prince Vasilko in his place. Burundi made his way from the middle reaches of the Dnieper, from the Vorskla and Psela regions, to the banks of the Neman, on the right bank of which was connected with the army of Vasilko Romanovich, who was marching from Berestye. The combined forces of the Mongols and Rusics advanced north, thoroughly ravaging the central Lithuanian province, where the city of Trakai, as well as Nelshan land was located. Rich trophies were captured, but the Russians were forced to give most of them to the Mongols. At the same time, the main Lithuanian troops escaped the main battle. The Russian-Horde army, passing through the land of the Yatvyag, turned in the opposite direction.
{Berke_Khan2_effects_desc}..

{Berke_Khan3}传记 (3rd part)
{Berke_Khan3_desc}The following year, Burundi embarked on a new campaign and marched through Volyn to Poland. In Shumsk, the Horde military leader was met by Vasilko Romanovich and Lev Danilovich, the son of Prince Daniel, who had fled to Hungary, as well as the Bishop Ivan of Kholm. Burundi ordered the princes to demolish the fortifications of Danilov, Stozhesk, Lviv, Kremenets and Lutsk, threatening, in case of disobedience, the devastation of their possessions. When the order was executed, Burundi moved to Vladimir-Volynsky, whose walls were also torn down. The inhabitants of the Hill, however, refused to obey and destroy the fortifications. Deciding not to besiege the city, the Mongols pretty much devastated its surroundings, subsequently headed for Polish possessions — to Lublin and Zavihost. Taking Sandomierz, whose townspeople were exterminated, as well as the small town of Lysets, the army of Burundai returned to the Dnieper. \n
   Fifteen years later, the war of the Golden Horde against the Hulaguids began in the Caucasus. Daniil Romanovich was forced to return to his homeland as the humble vassal of Khan Berke. The situation in the Mongol Empire in the early 1260s was notable for a fair amount of tension. In the confrontation between the brothers Khubilai and Arig-bugh, the khan of the Golden Horde, Berke, supported the latter, after the death of the great Khan Munke. However, Berke did not provide real military assistance to him. At the same time, taking advantage of the internal turmoil, the descendant of Chagatai - Algui intensified, in 1262 defeating the troops of Arig-boogie. Alguy subjugated Khorezm to himself, having driven out of all the fortresses the governors and officials of Berke. Also destroyed in Bukhara detachments of the Golden Horde in the number of 5,000 people. Berke's military forces were deployed in the south and west, so he could not oppose the rebel Alguy, who captured and destroyed the most important trading city of Otrar.
{Berke_Khan3_effects_desc}..

{Berke_Khan4}传记 (4th part)
{Berke_Khan4_desc}In the Caucasus, the conflict between Berke and Hulagu went into war in 1262. Prior to this, the army under the command of Khulagu, who had acted on an Iranian campaign in 1253, did not cross the Amu Darya only in early 1256, when it became known about the death of Batu. Most likely, the ruler of the Golden Horde expressed great dissatisfaction with the fact that another Mongol army will be fighting south of the borders of his possessions. Nevertheless, Batu complied with Munke’s order to recruit two warriors from each of ten for Iran and sent about three tumens of the Horde army to Khulag under the command of princes Balakan, Tutar and Kuli. Later, these troops took part in the assault on Baghdad (1258), and the faithful Berke, who had become the ruler of the Horde by that time, did not express obvious displeasure about this. Only after Hulag categorically refused to give Transcaucasia and South Azerbaijan to the Golden Horde as a share in the conquests did the enmity between cousins ​​noticeably intensify. \n
   In 1265, the Mongols, together with the Bulgarians, made a trip to Byzantium. The Horde army numbered about 20 thousand soldiers, moreover, both Berke and Nogai were in the Caucasus at that time. The allies did not attack Constantinople, but moved to the town of Enos, located at the mouth of the Maritsa, on the shores of the Aegean Sea, where, under the pretext of meeting with the emperor, the Seljuk Sultan Izz al-Din Kay-Kavus had moved shortly before. Having liberated the Sultan and captured a large number of the inhabitants of Thrace, the Horde returned to the Kypchak steppes.
{Berke_Khan4_effects_desc}..

{Berke_Khan5}传记 (ending)
{Berke_Khan5_desc}Izz ad-Din Kay-Kavus was favorably received by Khan Berke and lived in the Horde for the rest of his life, having received land in the Crimea for administration. The campaign in Thrace was also a punitive measure against Burke against Byzantium for allied relations with the Hulaguids. \n
   At first, Berke and the Persian Ilkhan Abaga maintained peaceful relations. Ilkhan even allowed the Horde to erect a mosque in Tabriz named Berke and workshops for dressing fabrics. Soon, however, the workshops were destroyed, and hostilities broke out with renewed vigor. It is not known what caused the renewal of the military conflict. In July 1265, an army led by Nogai promptly invaded South Azerbaijan through the Derbent Pass. Yushumut, the brother of Abagi, came forward, and on July 19, 1265 the two armies converged at the battle of Aksu. Nogai lost his eye in the battle, and his army was defeated. The Horde retreated north to Shirvan. \n
   Ilkhan crossed the Kura River with the main forces. The army of Khan Berke was moving forward, so Ilkhan Abaga returned to the southern bank of the river, having previously destroyed the crossings. Both troops camped and across the river began firing at each other with bows. This went on for 14 days. Burke moved to Tiflis, hoping to cross the Kuru in that direction. However, on the way, he suddenly fell ill and died. After the death of Berke, the Horde army did not continue the campaign and retreated north.

On the way back from Novgorod land to the steppe, Shiban, along with the main forces, moved along the western route, passing 30 km east of Smolensk, going to Vshchizh and then turning east to Kozelsk. At the end of 1239, Shiban, along with Buchek’s troops, invaded Crimea and took Surozh . In the last part of the western campaign, Shiban’s troops took part in the capture of Kiev, after the division of troops in Volhynia, Shiban, together with Batu and Subedai, took Galich in 3 days. After that, part of the corps, led by Kadan, separated to go on a more southern route. Both groups overcame the Carpathians and invaded Hungary, united for the battle of Chaillot, where the Hungarian troops were defeated (1241), then divided again. Shiban, together with Batu and Subedai, ravaged the lands of Slovakia and the Czech Republic, then joined with the Baidar corps that had come from the north after the victory at Legnica. The Mongols advanced their vanguards to Vienna, but did not go into a clash with the combined Czech-Austrian-Carinthian army. Around the same time, having received news of the death of the great khan Ugadei, they returned to the east.

   His main goal of accession to the throne was the overthrow of the Song Dynasty in China. After a stubborn and prolonged struggle, Khubilai took control of most of China by 1271, where he decided to establish a new dynasty, giving it the name Yuan. In 1279, the last Sung emperor died, and Khubilai finally consolidated his power over all of China, having established his capital in Beijing.

{Hulagu_Khan}传记 (1st part)
{Hulagu_Khan_desc}The grandson of Genghis Khan from the youngest son of Tuluy. The brother of the great Khan Mengu. Founder of the Mongol Hulagids dynasty in Persia. \n
   Hulagu took pride of place in the annals of history as the commander who led the Mongol Middle East campaign. The campaign was caused by complaints filed by the Great Mongol Khan Mengu, residents living in Qazvin and the mountainous regions of Persia. They asked the khan to relieve them of the harm caused by the Ismailis-Nizari (who were called Assassins in the West). On behalf of his elder brother, Hulagu in 1253 moved against the Ismailis. Historians report that each ulus was obliged to provide two soldiers from each of ten fighters to the Hulag army. Hulagu left the steppes of Mongolia in October 1253, but he moved very slowly. Such an unhurried movement of the Mongolian army was connected with the indignation of the head of the Ulus, Jochi khan Batu, who opposed the attack of the army of the Great Khan behind the Amu Darya, since he considered these lands as a sphere of influence of his ulus. Khan Mengu did not want to quarrel with the powerful Batu Khan, and only after his death did Khulagu cross the Amu Darya and besiege the Nizari fortresses in Kuhistan (Elburs). Most Ismaili strongholds surrendered without a fight and were destroyed by the Mongols. Only a few, including the illustrious Alamut, taken on December 15, 1256, showed little resistance. The citadel of Girdekukh, whose siege lasted several years, resisted the longest. As a result, Khan Khulagu captured and executed the head of the Ismailis Rokkned-din-Khurshah, tore down almost all the fortresses and completely exterminated this sect.
{Hulagu_Khan_effects_desc}..

{Hulagu_Khan2}传记 (2nd part)
{Hulagu_Khan2_desc}Having finished with the Ismailis, Khan Khulagu formally demanded from the Baghdad 哈里发al-Mustashim to recognize the power of the Mongols and received the expected refusal to go on the offensive. The Persian army under the command of the commander Fatah ad-din ibn Kerr suffered a crushing defeat on the banks of the Tigris. Having taken Baghdad in 1258 and devastated, Hulagu destroyed the power of the Abbasids and annexed all their possessions to the Mongol Empire. \n
   Having asserted his power in southwestern Iran, Hulagu with great difficulty conquered Syria, but could not keep it in his power. After the death of his brother, Mengu Hulagu went to Mongolia, but learned along the way that his other brother had already been elected to the throne, and returned. At this time, his troops, under the command of Kitbuki, were defeated by the Egyptian Sultan Beibars, who moved with a strong army to Syria to prevent the invasion of Hulag in his possession. Taking advantage of this, Syria fell away, and then the outbreak of war between the Hulagu and the Golden Horde prevented him from taking a new campaign to Syria. After these events, the power of the Mongols in Asia Minor and Syria weakened.

{ArigBuga_Khan}传记 (1st part)
{ArigBuga_Khan_desc}Arig-Bug is the youngest son of Toluy (the youngest son of Genghis Khan) and Sorkhakhtani. \n
   While his older brothers Munke and Khubilai fought in southern and western Asia, Arig-Bug remained in the indigenous Mongol possessions, so the most conservative part of Mongolian society rallied around him. After the death of the great khan Munke in 1259, the question of succession to the throne arose. There were two candidates for the post of Great Khan: Khubilai and Arig-Bug. On the side of Arig-Bugi stood one of the wives of Munke, as well as the sons of Munke Asutay and Urungtash. Assistance to Arig-Bug was also promised by the grandson of Ugedei Durchi, the grandson of Chagatai Algu and the grandson of Jochi Khurumshi. In addition, Arig-Bugi had influential allies, and not from among the Chingizids (for example, Bolgai is the most powerful person in the Mongol administration under Munch). Arig-Bug appointed Alandar as commander of his army and ordered him to gather troops north of the Gobi, while Durchi was to recruit an army south of this desert. Having learned about the actions of Arig-Bugi, Khubilai was forced to stop the attack on the Southern Song and return with the army to the north. In May 1260, the kurultai hastily convened in Kaiping proclaimed Khubilai the great khan. Since the elections were held outside the borders of the patrimonial Mongolian lands, and not all representatives of the ruling dynasty were present there, Arig-Bug protested the legality of these elections. In June 1260, another kurultai took place in Mongolia, on which Arig-Bug was proclaimed great khan. On the side of Argi-Bugi representatives of three of the four branches of the ruling dynasty spoke: Berke (a descendant of Jochi), Algu (a descendant of Chagatai) and many representatives of the Munke house. Khubilai's main follower was Hulagu.
{ArigBuga_Khan_effects_desc}..

{ArigBuga_Khan2}传记 (2nd part)
{ArigBuga_Khan2_desc}Khubilai’s strategy was to prevent Arig-Bug from taking advantage of agricultural holdings. Based on the base in Karakoram, Arig-Bug was supposed to provide food for his army, and Khubilai sought to cut him off from the supply centers. By 1262, Kadan (son of Ugadei and cousin of Khubilai) defeated Arig-Bugi supporters in the lands of the Uigurs and former lands of the Tagnuts. Khubilai’s army camped in northern China in the area of ​​the former Jin capital Zhongdu. Thus, under the rule of Arig-Bugi, only one agricultural region remained - the Yenisei Valley. In the fall of 1260, Khubilai led the army to Karakoram, and Arig-Buka retreated to Usa. Both armies are located in winter apartments. While Khubilai strengthened his position in the Chinese lands, Arig-Bug sought to maintain access to Central Asia, the army under the leadership of Alandar was supposed to guard the way there. \n
   However, at the end of 1260, Hadan captured Alandar near Silyan and, having defeated his army, beheaded Alandar. Since the grandson of Chagatai Algu entered the Arig-Bugi retinue, Arig-Bug persuaded Alga to declare his rights to Central Asia, where Ergene-Khatun rules , widow of Hara-Hulagu, another grandson of Chagatai. Kublai seated Abishka (also the grandson of Chagatai) on the throne of the Chagatai ulus, but the troops of Arig-Bugi intercepted, detained and killed Abishka. Algu was able to get to his destination and become a khan. As a result, Arig-Bugi had an indispensable ally who could supply him with desperately needed supplies.

{ArigBuga_Khan3}传记 (3rd part)
{ArigBuga_Khan3_desc}In November 1261, battles between the forces of Arig-Bugi and Khubilai took place, which did not bring victory to either side. Despite the uncertain outcome of the decisive battle, Khubilai was able to establish complete control over Mongolia. Arig-Bug was forced to seek help from his Central Asian ally, but by then Algu had already strengthened his own power and turned against his former friend. Arig-Bug defeated Alga in a battle on the Ili River and occupied its former base, forcing Alga to flee west - to Khotan and Kashgar. However, this turned out to be a pyrrhic victory: the new base was in the steppes, and there were still no sources of supplies of grain and weapons, and Algu's troops blocked approaches to the southern, more fertile areas of Xinjiang. \n
   During the harsh winter of 1263, the warriors of Arig-Bugi and civilians suffered from hunger, many people and horses died. By the spring of 1264, even some of the most ardent adherents had left him. Due to the desertion of supporters, Arig-Bug could not continue the struggle with Algu, and retreat could only be in the possession of Khubilai.

{ArigBuga_Khan4}传记 (4th part)
{ArigBuga_Khan4_desc}Arig-Bug decided to give up. He came to Shandu and appeared before Khubilai. After some hesitation caused by awkwardness, the brothers hugged and reconciled. At first, Khubilai did not punish his brother, but such indulgence pushed many of his supporters. To appease the disgruntled Mongols, Khubilai ordered Arig-Bug not to show his eyes for a year, but many found this punishment too lenient and demanded a purge among the traitors. Interrogating Arig-Bug and finding out who prompted him to challenge the rights of his elder brother, Khubilai executed the ten most important minions of Arig-Bugi. Khubilai did not want to take responsibility for the sole decision of his brother's fate and convened a kurultai for the trial of Arig-Bug (and also for confirmation of their own election to the throne of the great khan). However, Berke and Hulag waged an internecine war and could not leave their inheritance, and Algu himself was not yet established on the throne and therefore could not act as a judge in the Arig-Bugi case. \n
   However, all three khans soon died (Khulagu - in 1265, Burke and Algu - in 1266), and the fate of Arig-Bugi was in the hands of one Khubilai. However, Arig-Bug became seriously ill and died at the beginning of 1266, saving Khubilai from the difficulties associated with the need to arrange a trial of his brother.

{Munke_Khan}传记 (1st part)
{Munke_Khan_desc}Munke is the fourth great kagan (1251-1259) of the Mongol Empire, the grandson of Genghis Khan, the son of Toluya and Sorkaktani-begi, the brother of Khubilai, Khulagu and Arig-boogie. Known to the medieval West for his participation in the European campaign 1236-1242, during which the Mongol army reached the Adriatic. \n
   After the death of Khan Guyuk (1248) and the regency of his widow Ogul-Kaimysh, the descendants of Toluy were able to take over the supreme power in the empire. At the beginning of 1251, in the Karakorum, the Toluids and the Juchids who supported them gathered a kurultai, called to proclaim the great khan Munke. According to Rashid ad-Din, Batu, the ruler of Ulus Juchi, described Munke as follows: “Of all the princes, one Mengu-kaan has the talent and ability necessary for the khan, since he saw good and evil in this world, in any case tasted bitter and sweet, he repeatedly led troops in different directions to the war and differs from all others in his intelligence and abilities. ” To support him, Batu sent his brother Burke with the troops. In addition, the mother of Munke Sorkaktani was able to attract Belguei (brother of Genghis), who was highly respected, and Uryanhadai (son of Subedei), who had great authority in the army. Even part of the noyons from the hostile party of the Ugedeids and the Chagataids visited the kurultai, in particular the son of Ugedei Kadan, a member of the Western campaign. An attempt to oppose another candidate for the khans of Shiremun (grandson of Ugedey) failed. Since Munke gained supreme power in the great Kurultai, and Batu became aka (that is, the eldest of his kind), they were able to suppress the emerging dynastic unrest.

{Munke_Khan2}传记 (2nd part)
{Munke_Khan2_desc}Immediately after the victory, Munke conducted an investigation and trial, after which he ordered the execution of seventy-seven people from among his opponents - some princes of the clans of Ugedey and Chagatai and their Noyons (emirs in the terminology of Juvani and Rashid ad-Din), primarily Temniks and thousandths of their troops. Kaimysh was also executed along with a number of her supporters (after another investigation and trial). The possessions confiscated from them were divided between Munke and Batu, as well as other Genghisides who recognized their authority. \n
   After a successful power struggle, Munke paid attention to the conquests in Asia. In 1254, the Mongols captured Yunnan and invaded Indochina, while the brother of Munke Hulagu expanded the empire to approaches to Egypt (Middle Eastern campaign). Friendly relations with Batu helped to maintain the integrity of Mongol rule. In March 1258, the 40,000th army, under the personal command of the great khan, marched against South Song from Karakoram through Sichuan. In May, the army reached the Lupanshan (Gansu) mountains, where it was divided into three columns. On October 6, the Munke army convoy entered Hanzhong, on November 4 occupied Lizhou (Sichuan), on December 7 - the Dakhoshan fortress (near Tsansi). Munch died during the siege of the Chinese fishing city of Hezhou on the site of modern Chongqing, owned by South Song. About the causes of death, the sources tell in different ways. The sudden death of his brother forced Hulag to abandon the campaign in Syria and Egypt, and in fact led to the resumption of the struggle for power and the collapse of the Mongol empire.

In 1231-1232, individual detachments of the Chormagan army reached Sivas and Malatya, the possessions of the Koni Sultan. Chormagan’s power over the territories conquered in Persia began to gradually decrease due to the fact that Chin-Timur (1232/1233) was first appointed civilian ruler of Khorasan and Mazanderan, and then Uyghur Korkuz (1239/1240), whose subordinates began to levy taxes to the south from the Caucasus instead of the commanders of Chormagan.

{Baidju_mongol}传记 (1st part)
{Baidju_mongol_desc}Baiju or Bachu is a Mongol military leader of the middle of the 13th century, the imperial governor in Azerbaijan (north-western Iran), Transcaucasia and Asia Minor. \n
   He came from the Yisut (Besut) tribe and was a relative of the famous commander Jebe. In 1228, he took part in the battle with Jalal ad-Din at Isfahan, a year later, as a thousand-strong man, he launched a new campaign against Khorezmshah as part of a 30-thousand-strong army under the command of Noyon Chormagan. Baiju later became a temnik, and in 1242 succeeded Chormagan, paralyzed (or deceased), as commander of a local group of Mongolian troops stationed in Arran and the Mugan steppe. It is reported that he received this appointment by lot, since the Mongols were guided by the instructions of the magi. Baiju immediately began active action against the Koni Sultanate. He approached the Erzurum belonging to the Seljuks and invited the residents to surrender. In response to their refusal, the Mongols besieged the city and, using siege weapons, took it two months later. Erzurum was looted and destroyed, the inhabitants were killed or enslaved. Armenian chroniclers report that the Mongols seized many Christian books in the city - the lives of the saints, the richly decorated Gospels - and sold them for nothing to Christians serving in the army, and they were given away to churches and monasteries. Baiju left with the army for the winter in Mugan. The following year, the horse-drawn Sultan Giyas ad-Din Kay-Khosrov II led a large army against the Mongols.
{Baidju_mongol_effects_desc}..

{Baidju_mongol2}传记 (2nd part)
{Baidju_mongol2_desc}On June 26, the Seljuk army was defeated at Köse-dag, near Chmankatuk, west of Erzincan. Building on the success, Baiju took Sivas and Divrigi (the townspeople showed no resistance and were spared), and then Kayseri, the second capital of the Seljuks, and Erzincan (the locals tried to defend themselves and were massacred). Kay-Khosrov II could no longer resist the Mongols. According to the terms of the world, he had to send annually about 12 million hyperperons or local silver coins, 500 pieces of silk, 500 camels and 5,000 rams to Karakoram. However, the sultan, apparently having learned about the contradictions between Baiju and the ruler of Ulus, Jochi Batu, sent his ambassadors with the recognition of dependence on the latter. The ambassadors of Kei-Khosrov were favorably received, and the Seljuk ruler became a vassal of Batu. \n
   The 国王Cilician Armenia, Hetum I, who prudently did not support Kay-Khosrov II in the war against the Mongols, now sent an embassy to Baiju led by his father Konstantin Payl and brother Smbat Sparapet. The ambassadors, arriving at the general’s headquarters, “were introduced to Bachu-noin, the wife迷人agun, Eltin-Khatun, and other great nobles.” According to the agreement concluded between the parties, the Armenians undertook to supply the Mongol army with food and supply the necessary number of troops to participate in campaigns; in turn, the Mongol command recognized the sovereignty of the Cilician kingdom and promised to provide armed assistance to the Armenians in case of attack by neighboring states.
{Baidju_mongol2_effects_desc}..

{Baidju_mongol3}传记 (3rd part)
{Baidju_mongol3_desc}This treaty was beneficial to both Cilicia and Baiju, who needed allies in a region quite remote from Mongolia. As confirmation of the friendly intentions of the Cilicians, Baiju demanded that Hetum extradite the family of the Sultan Kei-Khosrov, who had found refuge in the Cilician kingdom. Hetum was forced to accept this condition. While Baiju was operating in Asia Minor, detachments under the command of Yasawur raided northern Syria on the territory of Damascus, Aleppo, Hama and Homs, the Ayyubid rulers of which were able to pay off the Mongols. From Boemund V, Prince of Antioch, they also demanded submission, but soon Yasawur was forced to withdraw his troops, apparently due to the summer heat, which had a detrimental effect on horses. \n
   The Mongol offensive forced the Khorezmians who wandered in Syria - the remnants of the Jalal ad-Din troops - to move to Palestine, where they captured Jerusalem (August 11, 1244), and then, together with the Egyptian sultan, defeated the crusader army at La Forbier, near Gaza (October 17) . Under the influence of these circumstances, Pope Innocent IV decided to send several embassies to the Mongol rulers. One of them, led by the Dominican Ascelin, on May 24, 1247, reached the Baiju headquarters near Sisian. Atselin and his companions did not show proper diplomacy, refusing to perform the ceremony of worship before Baiju and demanding that he adopt Christianity; they also refused to proceed to Karakorum on his orders, instructing the pope to transmit letters to the first Mongol commander met. All this nearly cost them their lives; from the execution of Ascelin was saved by the intercession of the Baiju advisers and the arrival at that moment of Eldzhigidei from Mongolia, whom the new Khan Guyuk appointed instead of Baiju.
{Baidju_mongol3_effects_desc}..

{Baidju_mongol4}传记 (4th part)
{Baidju_mongol4_desc}July 25, Ascelin left the Mongolian camp, with two documents in his hands - a reply to Baiju papa and the edict of Guyuk brought by Eldzhigidey. Ascelina was accompanied by two Mongolian ambassadors, Aybeg and Sergis, a Turk and a Syrian Nestorian. On November 22, Innocent IV conveyed to Aibeg and Sergis his response to the message to Baiju. After coming to power Munke (1251), the position of Baiju as commander of troops in northwestern Iran was confirmed by a new khan, Eljigidei was recalled and executed. In his reports to the central government, Baiju “complained about heretics and the Baghdad caliph”, in connection with which it was decided in Kurultai 1253 to send an army led by Khulag, the younger brother of Kaan, against the Iranian Ismailis and Abbasids of Baghdad. Baiju was ordered to prepare for the contentment of the troops “ one tagar of flour and a wineskin of wine "for each person. Khulagu, having set out on a campaign in early 1256, defeated the Ismaili fortresses in Iran by the end of 1257 and marched against Baghdad. Baiju went to the capital of the Abbasids from the direction of Irbil. Crossing the Tiger, his army defeated the 哈里发commanders Fatah al-Din Ibn Kurd and Karasonkur, and then occupied the western suburbs of Baghdad. \n
   After the capture of the city (February 1258), the Mongol troops were stationed in Mugan. Then, in September 1259, Hulagu entered Syria; forces under the command of Baiju were on the right wing of the army.

In 1240, Burundai participated in the capture of Kiev. Burundai’s participation in other episodes of the Western campaign, including a further campaign in Central Europe, is not known. In 1241, Batu helped during the conquest of Poland and the Galicia-Volyn principality. In 1251, during the power struggle in the Mongol Empire, Burundai, at the head of the 100,000th army, was sent by Batu near Otrar to help Munka against the descendants of Chagatai.

{Burundai_mongol2}传记 (2nd part)
{Burundai_mongol2_desc}In 1258, the Lithuanians ravaged the Principality of Smolensk and approached Torzhok, not meeting with opposition from Alexander Nevsky, who, together with other princes of North-Eastern Russia, was then in the Horde. Burundi transmitted to Daniel through the ambassadors: I am going to Lithuania; Even if you are peaceful, come with me. \n
   Daniel sent his younger brother Vasilk with the troops to help the Horde. The latter, after winning the victory over the Lithuanians, handed over to Burunda part of the spoils (“saigat”). In the following year, 1259, when the Romanovich brothers celebrated the wedding of the daughter of Vasilka Olga in Vladimir, an ambassador appeared from Burundai with the words: My natural amnesties are still dead, he will see me; and whoever does not give me less is my warrior. Daniel sent his brother Vasilka, his eldest son Leo and the Bishop of the Hill with gifts, to Burundi. Vasilko and Leo complied with the demand of Burundai to destroy the defensive fortifications of the cities of Danilov, Stojek, Kremenets, Lutsk and Lviv. Then, accompanied by Vasilka, Burundai went to Vladimir and demanded to disperse the fortress, stopping for the night near the Zhitani River. After Vasilk’s fulfillment of this requirement, Burundai, having feasted a few days in his yard, moved to the Hill, from which Daniel left for Hungary. Bending at the request of Burundai the townspeople to surrender, Vasilko made it clear to them that they should defend themselves. A few days later, the Horde retreated from the Hill and invaded Poland, capturing Lublin. Burundi through Vasilko and Leo promised the inhabitants of Sandomierz security in case of cessation of resistance, but did not keep this word: the Horde killed and drowned the people in the Vistula.
