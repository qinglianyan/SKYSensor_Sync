{king_barcelona}Earl of Barcelona \n Governor of Catalonia
{king_barcelona_desc}Named Earl of Barcelona and ruler of Catalonia. \n \nDescription: \nThere are two different legends regarding the founding of Barcelona. The first ascribes the foundation of the city to the hero of Greek myths Heracles 400 years before the foundation of Rome. The second legend attributes the founding of the city to Hamilcar (Amelkart) Barka to the father of Hannibal. Around 15 BC e. the Romans made a fortification from the city, the center of which was located on Mount Taber. However, its wealth and importance grew over time due to its convenient location and beautiful harbor. The city minted its own coins, some of which have survived from the time of Galba. The city grew within the walls until the Visigoths conquered it in the 5th century. At the beginning of the 8th century, the Moors conquered the city. In 801, the son of Charlemagne, Louis the Pious recaptured the city from the emir and made Barcelona the capital of the Spanish brand, a buffer zone under the control of the Count of Barcelona. Barcelona was still a Christian outpost when, in 985, it was sacked by al-Mansour. This attack gave the Count of Barcelona Borrel II an excuse to free himself from the Carolingian rule.

Visby's earliest history is unclear, but as you know, around 900 AD it was a shopping center. In the Viking era, the inhabitants of Gotland were actively trading, from the XI century. Gotlanders took a leading position in the intermediary trade in the Baltic Sea between Eastern and Western Europe. On the coast of the island there was a system of harbors called the Gothic coast. On the site of one of these harbors, the city of Visby subsequently arose. The control of the Swedish kings over the island, apparently, was rather weak. Thanks to the island's favorable location, the Gotlanders continued to dominate Baltic trade. Gotland merchants had their own guest house in Novgorod, and in the middle of the XII concluded an agreement with the Saxon Duke Heinrich Leo regarding the trading regime in Gotland and in Holstein.
