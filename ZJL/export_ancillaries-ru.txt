{dearmad_dublin}Lord of Dublin \nLord of Ireland
{dearmad_dublin_desc}Named Lord of Dublin and ruler of Ireland.\n\nDescription:\nApproximately 140 A.D. Ptolemy mentioned the Celtic settlement, which he called Eblan Civitas. According to these reports, the village already stood on the site of modern Dublin, although the city itself and the ramparts were laid by the Scandinavians much later. So Dublin became a stronghold of the small Viking kingdom on the island. Almost a hundred years later, in 1014, at the Battle of Klontarf, the Vikings suffered a crushing defeat from the Celtic king Brian Boru. The Viking kings began to pursue a policy of alliances and agreements with local tribes, which allowed them to retain power in Over the course of three centuries, Dublin became the stronghold of the British government in Ireland in 1169, when English troops led by Henry II Plantagenet invaded the island.

{king_barcelona}Earl of Barcelona \n Governor of Catalonia
{king_barcelona_desc}Named Earl of Barcelona and ruler of Catalonia.\n\nDescription:\nThere are two different legends regarding the founding of Barcelona. The first ascribes the foundation of the city to the hero of Greek myths Heracles 400 years before the foundation of Rome. The second legend attributes the founding of the city to Hamilcar (Amelkart) Barka to the father of Hannibal. Around 15 BC e. the Romans made a fortification from the city, the center of which was located on Mount Taber. However, its wealth and importance grew over time due to its convenient location and beautiful harbor. The city minted its own coins, some of which have survived from the time of Galba. The city grew within the walls until the Visigoths conquered it in the 5th century. At the beginning of the 8th century, the Moors conquered the city. In 801, the son of Charlemagne, Louis the Pious recaptured the city from the emir and made Barcelona the capital of the Spanish brand, a buffer zone under the control of the Count of Barcelona. Barcelona was still a Christian outpost when, in 985, it was sacked by al-Mansour. This attack gave the Count of Barcelona Borrel II an excuse to free himself from the Carolingian rule.
